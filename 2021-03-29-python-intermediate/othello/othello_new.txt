Cassio. You aduise me well                                            1157

Clo. Oh, thereby hangs a tale                                         1159

Des. A guiltlesse death, I dye.                                       1163
Des. A man that all his time                                          1164
Des. Alacke, my Lord,                                                 1165
Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)                                      1166
Des. Alas Iago,                                                       1167
Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.                            1168
Des. Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?                            1169
Des. Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone                               1170
Des. Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?                        1171
Des. Alas: she ha's no speech                                         1172
Des. All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?               1173
Des. Am I that name, Iago?                                            1174
Des. And haue you mercy too. I neuer did                              1175
Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico                        1176
Des. And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then                      1177
Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse                      1178
Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong                           1179
Des. But halfe an houre                                               1180
Des. But shall't be shortly?                                          1181
Des. But while I say one prayer                                       1182
Des. Can any thing be made of this?                                   1183
Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?               1184
Des. Come on, assay.                                                  1185
Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient                  1186
Des. Do not doubt that: before aemilia here,                          1187
Des. Go too: where lodges he?                                         1188
Des. Good night, good night:                                          1189
Des. He found it then:                                                1190
Des. He saies he will returne incontinent,                            1191
Des. He speakes well.                                                 1192
Des. He will not say so                                               1193
Des. Heauen doth truely know it                                       1194
Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.                    1195
Des. Heere my Lord                                                    1196
Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with                      1197
Des. How now my Lord?                                                 1198
Des. How now, my deere Othello?                                       1199
Des. How? vnlawfully?                                                 1200
Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile                                 1201
Des. I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then?              1202
Des. I cannot speake of this:                                         1203
Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.                         1204
Des. I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!                 1205
Des. I haue it not about me                                           1206
Des. I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia,                        1207
Des. I haue not deseru'd this                                         1208
Des. I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest                          1209
Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:                     1210
Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,                                    1211
Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:                  1212
Des. I will not stay to offend you                                    1213
Des. I will so: What's the matter?                                    1214
Des. I, but not yet to dye                                            1215
Des. If 'twere no other                                               1216
Des. If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.                         1217
Des. If you say, I hope you will not kill me                          1218
Des. Indeed? Is't true?                                               1219
Des. Insooth, you are too blame                                       1220
Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.                             1221
Des. Is't possible?                                                   1222
Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow                        1223
Des. Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night                          1224
Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him                                 1225
Des. My Lord                                                          1226
Des. My Lord                                                          1227

Des. My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie,                            1229
Des. My deere Othello                                                 1230
Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,                      1231
Des. Nor would I there recide,                                        1232
Des. O Heauen haue mercy on me                                        1233

Iago. I am your owne for euer.                                        1382
Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd                                     1383
Iago. I cry you mercy: here's Cassio hurt by Villaines                1384
Iago. I do beseech you,                                               1385

Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe                       1389
Iago. I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are                  1390
Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so                                  1391

Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:                            1396
Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,                       1397
Iago. I told him what I thought,                                      1398
Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the                       1399
Iago. I, there's the point:                                           1400
Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a                    1401
Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.                             1402
Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:                        1403
Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why               1404
Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her                 1405
Iago. Ile send her to you presently:                                  1406
Iago. Indeed?                                                         1407
Iago. Infaith too much:                                               1408
Iago. Is my Lord angry?                                               1409
Iago. Is't come to this?                                              1410
Iago. Is't possible my Lord?                                          1411
Iago. Is't possible?                                                  1412
Iago. It is but so, I warrant,                                        1413
Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission              1414
Iago. It's true, good Lieutenant                                      1415
Iago. Kinde Gentlemen:                                                1416

Iago. Marry heauen forbid:                                            1421
Iago. Men should be what they seeme,                                  1422
Iago. My Friend is dead:                                              1423
Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue                                        1424
Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor                     1425

Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you                                    1427
Iago. My Noble Lord                                                   1428
Iago. My Noble Lord                                                   1429
Iago. Nay but he prated,                                              1430
Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,                       1431
Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,                          1432
Iago. Nay, that's not your way                                        1433
Iago. No, let me not                                                  1434
Iago. Not I, for this faire Island,                                   1435
Iago. Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten                     1436

Iago. O mee, Lieutenant!                                              1440
Iago. O notable Strumpet. Cassio, may you suspect                     1441

Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,                   1451
Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.                     1452
Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,                       1453
Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)                                      1454
Iago. Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon:                     1455

Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:                       1463
Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,                   1464
Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:                     1465
Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,                    1466

Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her                            1489
Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man                        1490
Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and                      1491
Iago. Why, there's no remedie.                                        1492

Officer. Here is more Newes.                                          1552
Oth. 'Tis he: O braue Iago, honest, and iust,                         1553
Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes                              1554
Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:                  1555
Oth. Amen, with all my heart                                          1556
Oth. And so she did                                                   1557
Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe                          1558
Oth. Are you wise?                                                    1559
Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:                   1560
Oth. Away.                                                            1561
Oth. Being done, there is no pawse                                    1562
Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,                         1563
Oth. By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.                      1564
Oth. By the World,                                                    1565
Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.                        1566
Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme                          1567
Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports          1568
Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:                                            1569
Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?                          1570
Oth. Dost thou say so?                                                1571
Oth. Downe Strumpet                                                   1572
Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait                   1573
Oth. Farewell, farewell:                                              1574
Oth. Feare not my gouernment                                          1575
Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,                                      1576
Oth. Fetcht, let me see't                                             1577
Oth. Fire, and brimestone                                             1578
Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall                          1579
Oth. Giue me your hand.                                               1580
Oth. Good, good:                                                      1581
Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?                                            1582
Oth. Ha?                                                              1583
Oth. Hah?                                                             1584
Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well                                        1585
Oth. He hath confest                                                  1586
Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago                                    1587
Oth. Humh                                                             1588
Oth. I                                                                1589
Oth. I am bound to thee for euer                                      1590
Oth. I am too blame                                                   1591
Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he                                            1592
Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:                         1593
Oth. I greet thy loue,                                                1594
Oth. I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia.                           1595
Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:                       1596
Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,                           1597
Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,                 1598
Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,                1599
Oth. I say, Amen                                                      1600
Oth. I thinke so too                                                  1601
Oth. I thinke thou do'st:                                             1602
Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?                         1603
Oth. I will deny thee nothing.                                        1604
Oth. I will not                                                       1605
Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:                          1606
Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st                                       1607
Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story                         1608
Oth. If it be that                                                    1609
Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,                        1610
Oth. If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime                          1611
Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts                                            1612
Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces                                      1613
Oth. It is euen so                                                    1614
Oth. It is the very error of the Moone,                               1615
Oth. It is too late.                                                  1616
Oth. Looke how he laughes already                                     1617
Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,                       1618
Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest                               1619
Oth. Nay, if you striue                                               1620
Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?                                   1621
Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,                            1622
Oth. No, not much mou'd:                                              1623
Oth. No: his mouth is stopp'd:                                        1624
Oth. Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,                   1625
Oth. Not?                                                             1626
Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out                     1627
Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:                   1628
Oth. O Villaine!                                                      1629
Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!                                          1630
Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft                             1631
Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood                                           1632
Oth. Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke                         1633
Oth. Oh she was fowle!                                                1634
Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;                                     1635
Oth. Oh, oh, oh                                                       1636
Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine                                 1637
Oth. Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?                   1638
Oth. Peace, and be still                                              1639
Oth. Peace, you were best.                                            1640
Oth. Presently.                                                       1641
Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:                      1642
Oth. Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd?                              1643
Oth. Say you?                                                         1644
Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:                            1645
Oth. She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.                        1646
Oth. She was false as water.                                          1647
Oth. She's like a Liar gone to burning hell,                          1648
Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes                          1649
Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:                          1650
Oth. Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,                    1651
Oth. That which I gaue you                                            1652
Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe                               1653
Oth. The Handkerchiefe                                                1654
Oth. The Handkerchiefe                                                1655
Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes                                             1656
Oth. This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't?                   1657
Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:                   1658
Oth. Well, thou dost best                                             1659
Oth. Went he hence now?                                               1660
Oth. What do'st thou thinke?                                          1661
Oth. What dost thou meane?                                            1662
Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?                                        1663
Oth. What hath he said?                                               1664
Oth. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?                1665
Oth. What promise, Chucke?                                            1666
Oth. What then?                                                       1667
Oth. What? now?                                                       1668
Oth. Who is't you meane?                                              1669
Oth. Why any thing:                                                   1670
Oth. Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?                       1671
Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?                                        1672
Oth. Why, how should she be murdred?                                  1673
Oth. Why? why is this?                                                1674
Oth. Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona                                 1675
Oth. With her?                                                        1676
Oth. With mine Officer?                                               1677
Oth. Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead.                       1678
Oth. Your Napkin is too little:                                       1679
Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast                           1680
Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)                                     1681
Othe. Are not you a Strumpet?                                         1682
Othe. Are you sure of that?                                           1683
Othe. Aunciant, conduct them:                                         1684
Othe. Bid her come hither: go.                                        1685
Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:                  1686
Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.                                     1687
Othe. Did he confesse it?                                             1688
Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,                                         1689
Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not                   1690
Othe. Had it pleas'd Heauen,                                          1691
Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate                 1692
Othe. Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell               1693
Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:                            1694
Othe. Hold for your liues                                             1695
Othe. Hold your hands                                                 1696
Othe. How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot?                    1697
Othe. I cry you mercy then.                                           1698

Aemilia, Wife to Iago.                                                2341
Affaire                                                               2342
After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,                             2343
After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,                            2344
After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son                     2345
Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen                       2346
Against the Moore. For I do know the State,                           2347
Against the generall Enemy Ottoman.                                   2348
Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue            2349
Alas my Friend, and my deere Countryman                               2350
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?                                2351
Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,                                  2352

All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are      2354
All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:                        2355
All my abilities in thy behalfe.                                      2356
All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.                 2357
All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake                       2358
Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;                         2359
Am I put to our Cassio in some Action                                 2360
Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord?                              2361
An Instrument of this your calling backe,                             2362
An honest man he is, and hates the slime                              2363
An honourable Murderer, if you will:                                  2364
An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?                             2365
An indistinct regard                                                  2366
An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,                     2367
An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well                         2368
And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword                        2369
And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night                          2370
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,                           2371
And Comforts should encrease                                          2372
And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?                   2373
And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke                   2374
And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient                      2375
And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe                          2376
And I a heauie interim shall support                                  2377
And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona                           2378
And I did giu't my Husband                                            2379
And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.                             2380
And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore                              2381
And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates                        2382
And Wit depends on dilatory time:                                     2383
And all indigne, and base aduersities,                                2384
And aske him                                                          2385
And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,                         2386
And being troubled with a raging tooth,                               2387
And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)                         2388
And bid me to dismisse you                                            2389
And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde                         2390
And bring them after in the best aduantage.                           2391
And by him do my duties to the Senate:                                2392
And by how much she striues to do him good,                           2393
And call thy husband hither.                                          2394
And cannot make away                                                  2395
And certainly in strange vnquietnesse                                 2396
And chides with thinking                                              2397
And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,                      2398
And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,                    2399
And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.                     2400
And euer will, (though he do shake me off                             2401
And fall to Reprobance                                                2402
And fearefull to be granted                                           2403
And fixe most firme thy Resolution                                    2404
And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,                    2405
And giu't Iago: what he will do with it                               2406
And giue direction. And do but see his vice,                          2407
And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd                            2408
And goe with you                                                      2409
And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue                      2410
And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome                    2411
And happily repent                                                    2412
And hath commanded me to go to bed,                                   2413
And hath in his effect a voice potentiall                             2414
And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation                         2415
And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,                      2416
And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,                     2417
And he himselfe confest it but euen now,                              2418
And he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance,                    2419
And he retires. Where should Othello go?                              2420
And he shall our Commission bring to you:                             2421
And he that is approu'd in this offence,                              2422
And he's Indited falsely.                                             2423
And heere another, the one of them imports                            2424
And hell gnaw his bones.                                              2425
And his owne courses will denote him so,                              2426
And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue                              2427
And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,                               2428
And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor                            2429
And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,                            2430
And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus                            2431
And it is still it selfe                                              2432
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets                       2433
And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull                         2434
And keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you.                         2435
And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit                       2436
And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe                        2437
And lay a Sentence,                                                   2438
And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,                               2439
And let her speake of me before her Father;                           2440
And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,                          2441
And let me finde a Charter in your voice                              2442
And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:                               2443
And let me the Cannakin clinke.                                       2444
And let our selues againe but vnderstand,                             2445
And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas                      2446
And like the Diuell from his very Arme                                2447
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;                     2448
And little of this great world can I speake,                          2449
And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,                                2450
And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her                         2451
And long liue you to thinke so                                        2452
And lookes not on his euills: is not this true?                       2453
And looses that it workes for                                         2454
And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.                   2455
And made you to suspect me with the Moore                             2456
And makes me call, what I intend to do,                               2457
And makes me poore indeed                                             2458
And makes men mad.                                                    2459
And many a ciuill Monster                                             2460
And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,                              2461
And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,                           2462
And marke how he continues                                            2463
And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes                 2464
And my Lieutenant?                                                    2465
And needs no other Suitor, but his likings                            2466
And new create his fault?                                             2467
And not by old gradation, where each second                           2468
And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,                      2469
And nothing can, or shall content my Soule                            2470
And nothing of a man                                                  2471
And of the Canibals that each others eate,                            2472
And often did beguile her of her teares,                              2473
And on the proofe, there is no more but this,                         2474
And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,                           2475
And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)                        2476
And portance in my Trauellours historie.                              2477
And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;                          2478
And practising vpon his peace, and quiet,                             2479
And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted                     2480
And prayes you to beleeue him                                         2481
And put in euery honest hand a whip                                   2482
And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:                         2483
And raise some speciall Officers of might:                            2484
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,                                 2485
And say, if I shall see you soone at night?                           2486
And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.                               2487
And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore,                             2488
And she did gratifie his amorous workes                               2489
And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,                          2490
And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,                       2491
And she in mine                                                       2492
And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,                   2493
And she's obedient: as you say obedient.                              2494
And shut my selfe vp in some other course                             2495
And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,                        2496
And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.                  2497
And sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch                     2498
And smoate him, thus                                                  2499
And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:                                 2500
And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd                                2501
And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne          2502
And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,                         2503
And speed must answer it                                              2504
And spend your rich opinion, for the name                             2505
And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes                           2506
And stood within the blanke of his displeasure                        2507
And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)                      2508
And such things else of qualitie and respect                          2509
And sweet Reuenge growes harsh                                        2510
And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,                 2511
And take thy awl'd Cloake about thee.                                 2512
And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:                          2513
And tell she come, as truely as to heauen,                            2514
And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,                      2515
And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:                     2516
And then of so gentle a condition?                                    2517
And there will I be with him. So farewell.                            2518
And therefore little shall I grace my cause,                          2519
And they Watch too.                                                   2520
And thinke it no addition, nor my wish                                2521
And this, and this the greatest discords be                           2522
And thou art but of low degree:                                       2523
And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:                    2524
And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,                             2525
And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords                     2526
And to defend our selues, it be a sinne                               2527
And to his Honours and his valiant parts,                             2528
And to obey shall be in me remorse,                                   2529
And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,                            2530
And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:                       2531
And told no more                                                      2532
And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.                      2533
And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.                               2534
And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,                2535
And what's to come of my despised time,                               2536
And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,                         2537
And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,                  2538
And when they haue lin'd their Coates                                 2539
And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose                              2540
And will not hear't. What commited?                                   2541
And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:                            2542
And will vpon the instant put thee too't.                             2543
And would, in Action glorious, I had lost                             2544
And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:                          2545
And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason                           2546
And yet me thinkes right modest                                       2547
And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.               2548
And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,                             2549
And your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come:                        2550

Any begining to this peeuish oddes.                                   2553

Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,                            2555
Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,                     2556
Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that                       2557
Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?                            2558
Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,                             2559
Are you not well?                                                     2560
Arise I say                                                           2561
Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,                         2562
Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:                             2563
As (to be bold with you)                                              2564
As Asses are:                                                         2565

As I haue spoken for you all my best,                                 2570
As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,                               2571
As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token                               2572
As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words       2573
As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,                            2574
As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)                    2575
As doth import you                                                    2576
As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:                          2577
As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.                          2578
As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,                        2579
As friendly as you were                                               2580
As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit                                   2581
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:                              2582
As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,                         2583
As iealious Creatures are, it were enough                             2584

As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this                    2589
As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed                            2590
As it may loose some colour                                           2591
As leuels with her breeding                                           2592
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,                      2593
As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,                      2594
As my yong Mistris dogge.                                             2595
As nothing else could match                                           2596
As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,                              2597
As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.                       2598

As this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago,                           2602
As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts                 2603
As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,                           2604
As well to see the Vessell that's come in,                            2605
As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire                            2606
As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things                        2607
As you that thus abuse me.                                            2608
Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,                             2609

But (pardon me) I do not in position                                  2649

But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,                         2651
But I do see y'are moou'd:                                            2652

But neuer more be Officer of mine.                                    2675
But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,                          2676
But not instinctiuely: I did consent,                                 2677
But notwithstanding with my personall eye                             2678

I do repent me, that I put it to you.                                 3201
I feare the trust Othello puts him in,                                3202
I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake                                3203
I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.                        3204
I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.                             3205

I found it in my Chamber,                                             3207
I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:                            3208
I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,                        3209

I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,                      3211
I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.                           3212
I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes                 3213

I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a                       3215

I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:                  3220
I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,                   3221
I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I                     3222
I haue lost him too                                                   3223
I haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife:                      3224
I haue made my way through more impediments                           3225
I haue no iudgement in an honest face.                                3226
I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,                   3227
I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.                                      3228
I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,                      3229

I here do giue thee that with all my heart,                           3233
I hope you will consider what is spoke                                3234

I humbly do beseech you of your pardon                                3236
I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place.                        3237
I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:                            3238
I know not where is that Promethaean heate                            3239
I know our Country disposition well:                                  3240
I know this acte shewes horrible and grim                             3241
I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.                   3242
I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded                             3243
I lye                                                                 3244

I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,                            3247

I neuer did like mollestation view                                    3249
I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:                            3250
I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.                                3251
I prattle out of fashion, and I doate                                 3252
I pray you Sir, hold your hand                                        3253
I pray you after the Lieutenant, go                                   3254

I prythee name the time, but let it not                               3259
I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,                          3260
I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,                          3261
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,                                   3262
I saw the Handkerchiefe                                               3263
I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:                        3264
I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,                              3265
I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?                         3266
I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,                         3267
I say, thy Husband.                                                   3268
I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,                   3269
I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,                        3270
I should but teach him how to tell my Story,                          3271
I should haue found in some place of my Soule                         3272
I should make very Forges of my cheekes,                              3273
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.          3274
I stand accomptant for as great a sin)                                3275
I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,                               3276
I thanke you for this profit, and from hence                          3277
I that am cruell, am yet mercifull,                                   3278
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,                             3279
I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?                       3280
I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?                          3281
I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:                    3282
I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?                   3283
I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:                 3284
I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:                       3285
I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.                      3286
I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.                     3287
I tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge,                          3288
I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,                         3289
I vnderstand a Fury in your words                                     3290
I warrant it greeues my Husband,                                      3291
I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)                                   3292
I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,                             3293
I will be found most cunning in my Patience:                          3294
I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake                    3295
I will bestow you where you shall haue time                           3296
I will but spend a word here in the house,                            3297
I will deny thee nothing                                              3298
I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)                   3299
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,                               3300
I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,                         3301
I will make proofe of thine                                           3302

I won his Daughter                                                    3304
I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)                       3305
I would not haue thee linger in thy paine?                            3306
I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,                         3307
I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,                               3308
I would not my vnhoused free condition                                3309
I would on great occasion, speake with you.                           3310
I would to heauen he were                                             3311
I'ld not haue sold her for it.                                        3312
I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde                     3313

In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all       3384
In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,                             3385
In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull                       3386
In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.                               3387
In fearefull sense                                                    3388
In following him, I follow but my selfe.                              3389
In happy time, Iago                                                   3390
In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:                            3391
In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,                         3392
In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,                          3393
In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter                       3394
In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.                               3395
In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?                      3396
In one of these same Sheetes.                                         3397
In opposition bloody. I cannot speake                                 3398
In simple and pure soule, I come to you                               3399
In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,                           3400
In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)            3401

Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)              3408
Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.                               3409
Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,                             3410
Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)                         3411
Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;               3412
Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,                          3413
Is foule as Slander                                                   3414
Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:                         3415
Is he not honest?                                                     3416
Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth                             3417
Is it not an Alarum to Loue?                                          3418
Is naught but bitternesse. Now Rodorigo,                              3419
Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne                           3420
Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,                               3421
Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,                          3422
Is spied in populus Citties                                           3423
Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;                              3424
Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.                             3425
Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?                         3426
Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,                            3427
Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,                      3428
Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,                              3429
Is't come to this? Well, well                                         3430
It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,                             3431
It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies                          3432
It is a common thing-                                                 3433
It is a great price, for a small vice                                 3434
It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.                         3435
It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,                                    3436
It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:                                  3437
It is impossible to beare it out.                                     3438
It is impossible you should see this,                                 3439
It is most true: true I haue married her;                             3440
It is not honestie in me to speake                                    3441
It is so too. And haue not we Affections?                             3442
It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,                          3443
It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke                       3444
It is true indeede                                                    3445
It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,                         3446
It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,                                 3447
It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.                     3448
It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place                        3449
It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,                      3450
It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,                       3451
It speakes against her with the other proofes                         3452
It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.                           3453
It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes                             3454
It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token                              3455
It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:                     3456
It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,                       3457
It were an honest Action, to say so                                   3458
It were not for your quiet, nor your good,                            3459
It will be well                                                       3460
Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,                      3461
Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:                      3462

Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:                         3838
Shall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,                    3839

Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome                        3841
Shar'd dangers with you                                               3842
She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,                        3843
She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:                          3844
She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.                           3845
She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,                     3846
She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted                          3847
She is perswaded I will marry her                                     3848
She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,                              3849
She lou'd them most                                                   3850
She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man                                3851
She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,                              3852
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,                            3853
She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud                             3854
She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.                            3855
She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,              3856
She that being angred, her reuenge being nie,                         3857
She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,                   3858
She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,                             3859
She was a Charmer, and could almost read                              3860
She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)                          3861
She was false?                                                        3862
She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,                         3863
She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine                          3864
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd                       3865
She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare                          3866
She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit                    3867
Shee false with Cassio?                                               3868
Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming                      3869
Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe                              3870
Shew me thy thought                                                   3871
Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,                       3872
Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light,                       3873
Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second                        3874
Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt                  3875
Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,                     3876
Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare                 3877

So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer                             3886
So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:                         3887

So may he with more facile question beare it,                         3892
So much I challenge, that I may professe                              3893
So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd                              3894
So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha                                   3895
So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,                             3896
So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye                                  3897

So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind                             3899
So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha                                            3900
So was I bid report here to the State,                                3901
