Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,    49
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a    50
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any    51
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.         52
                                                                        53
                                                                        54
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance         55
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.         56
                                                                        57
Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till         58
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.         59
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at         60
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A         61
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment         62
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an         63
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes         64
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has         65
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a         66
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a         67
new copy has at least one byte more or less.                            68
                                                                        69
                                                                        70
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)                          71
                                                                        72
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The        73
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours        74
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright        75
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This        76
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value        77
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2        78
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text        79
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+        80
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the        81
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.        82
                                                                        83
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext        84
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]        85
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,        86
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.              87
                                                                        88
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third        89
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we        90
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly        91
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an        92
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few        93
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we        94
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.          95
                                                                        96

tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor          174
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at           175
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other               176
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright          177
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and            178
distribute it in the United States without permission and              179

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable               184
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain            185
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any            186
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other              187
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or         188
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other               189
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged             190

***                                                                    312
                                                                       313
As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words        314
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the       315
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling      316
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions        317
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,      318
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming       319
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .      320
                                                                       321
The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a      322
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in      323
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,      324
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend      325
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.              326
                                                                       327
You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I      328
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an      329
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a      330
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an      331
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University      332
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the      333
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available      334
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,      335
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a      336
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous      337
for signing his name with several different spellings.                 338
                                                                       339
So, please take this into account when reading the comments below      340
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors      341
that are "not" errors. . . .                                           342
                                                                       343
So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,      344
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie      345
of Othello, the Moore of Venice.                                       346

Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from          356
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can        357
come in ASCII to the printed text.                                     358
                                                                       359
The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the               360
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,       361
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the                362
printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put     363
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the       364
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified            365
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded             366
abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within           367
brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that           368
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a            369
purer Shakespeare.                                                     370
                                                                       371
Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual    372
differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may   373
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between        374
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's     375
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and       376
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then        377
continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but     378
incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.     379
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different         380
First Folio editions' best pages.                                      381
                                                                       382
If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation        383
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel        384
free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best           385
etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com    386

Rodorigo. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly                       397
That thou (Iago) who hast had my purse,                                398
As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this                     399

Ia. But you'l not heare me. If euer I did dream                        401
Of such a matter, abhorre me                                           402

Rodo. Thou told'st me,                                                 404
Thou did'st hold him in thy hate                                       405
                                                                       406
Iago. Despise me                                                       407
If I do not. Three Great-ones of the Cittie,                           408

Off-capt to him: and by the faith of man                               410
I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place.                         411
But he (as louing his owne pride, and purposes)                        412
Euades them, with a bumbast Circumstance,                              413
Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre,                               414
Non-suites my Mediators. For certes, saies he,                         415
I haue already chose my Officer. And what was he?                      416
For-sooth, a great Arithmatician,                                      417
One Michaell Cassio, a Florentine,                                     418
(A Fellow almost damn'd in a faire Wife)                               419
That neuer set a Squadron in the Field,                                420
Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes                                  421
More then a Spinster. Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke:                   422
Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose                                423
As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)                     424
Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;                425
And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe                           426
At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds                            427
Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be-leed, and calm'd                   428
By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter-caster,                         429
He (in good time) must his Lieutenant be,                              430
And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient                       431
                                                                       432
Rod. By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman                    433
                                                                       434
Iago. Why, there's no remedie.                                         435
'Tis the cursse of Seruice;                                            436
Preferment goes by Letter, and affection,                              437
And not by old gradation, where each second                            438
Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe,                439
Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd                                 440
To loue the Moore?                                                     441
Rod. I would not follow him then                                       442
                                                                       443
Iago. O Sir content you.                                               444
I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.                              445
We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters                              446
Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke                             447
Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;                                448
That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage)                           449
Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse,                       450
For naught but Prouender, & when he's old Casheer'd.                   451
Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are                           452
Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie,                            453
Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues,                        454
And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords                      455
Doe well thriue by them.                                               456
And when they haue lin'd their Coates                                  457
Doe themselues Homage.                                                 458
These Fellowes haue some soule,                                        459
And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)                       460
It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,                                     461
Were I the Moore, I would not be Iago:                                 462
In following him, I follow but my selfe.                               463
Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,                          464
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:                                   465
For when my outward Action doth demonstrate                            466
The natiue act, and figure of my heart                                 467
In Complement externe, 'tis not long after                             468
But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue                               469
For Dawes to pecke at; I am not what I am                              470
                                                                       471
Rod. What a fall Fortune do's the Thicks-lips owe                      472
If he can carry't thus?                                                473
Iago. Call vp her Father:                                              474
Rowse him, make after him, poyson his delight,                         475
Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen,                     476
And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,                              477
Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy,                     478
Yet throw such chances of vexation on't,                               479
As it may loose some colour                                            480
                                                                       481
Rodo. Heere is her Fathers house, Ile call aloud                       482
                                                                       483
Iago. Doe, with like timerous accent, and dire yell,                   484
As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire                             485
Is spied in populus Citties                                            486
                                                                       487
Rodo. What hoa: Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, hoa                      488
                                                                       489
Iago. Awake: what hoa, Brabantio: Theeues, Theeues.                    490
Looke to your house, your daughter, and your Bags,                     491
Theeues, Theeues                                                       492
                                                                       493
Bra. Aboue. What is the reason of this terrible                        494
Summons? What is the matter there?                                     495
Rodo. Signior is all your Familie within?                              496
Iago. Are your Doores lock'd?                                          497
Bra. Why? Wherefore ask you this?                                      498
Iago. Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne,                   499
Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule                    500
Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram                             501
Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,                               502
Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell,                            503
Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you.                      504
Arise I say                                                            505
                                                                       506
Bra. What, haue you lost your wits?                                    507
Rod. Most reuerend Signior, do you know my voice?                      508
Bra. Not I: what are you?                                              509
Rod. My name is Rodorigo                                               510
                                                                       511
Bra. The worsser welcome:                                              512
I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores:                      513
In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,                          514
My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse                       515
(Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes)                      516
Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come                                517
To start my quiet                                                      518
                                                                       519
Rod. Sir, Sir, Sir                                                     520
                                                                       521
Bra. But thou must needs be sure,                                      522
My spirits and my place haue in their power                            523
To make this bitter to thee                                            524
                                                                       525
Rodo. Patience good Sir                                                526
                                                                       527
Bra. What tell'st thou me of Robbing?                                  528
This is Venice: my house is not a Grange                               529
                                                                       530
Rodo. Most graue Brabantio,                                            531
In simple and pure soule, I come to you                                532
                                                                       533
Ia. Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God,                 534
if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice,              535
and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daughter              536
couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Nephewes                537
neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens:                         538
and Gennets for Germaines                                              539
                                                                       540
Bra. What prophane wretch art thou?                                    541
Ia. I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daughter                542
and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs                     543
                                                                       544
Bra. Thou art a Villaine                                               545
                                                                       546
Iago. You are a Senator                                                547
                                                                       548
Bra. This thou shalt answere. I know thee Rodorigo                     549
                                                                       550
Rod. Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you                  551
If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent,                          552
(As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,                     553
At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night                           554
Transported with no worse nor better guard,                            555
But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,                          556
To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:                           557
If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,                          558
We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.                         559
But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,                          560
We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue                              561
That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,                                  562
I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.                      563
Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)                        564
I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,                               565
Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes                            566
In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,                              567
Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.                568
If she be in her Chamber, or your house,                               569
Let loose on me the Iustice of the State                               570
For thus deluding you                                                  571
                                                                       572
Bra. Strike on the Tinder, hoa:                                        573
Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people,                                574
This Accident is not vnlike my dreame,                                 575
Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie.                                   576
Light, I say, light.                                                   577
Enter.                                                                 578
                                                                       579
Iag. Farewell: for I must leaue you.                                   580
It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place                         581
To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)                              582
Against the Moore. For I do know the State,                            583
(How euer this may gall him with some checke)                          584
Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd                        585
With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,                            586
(Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules                   587
Another of his Fadome, they haue none,                                 588
To lead their Businesse. In which regard,                              589
Though I do hate him as I do hell paines,                              590
Yet, for necessitie of present life,                                   591
I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,                             592
(Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him              593
Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search:                                594
And there will I be with him. So farewell.                             595
                                                                       596
Enter.                                                                 597
                                                                       598
Enter Brabantio, with Seruants and Torches.                            599
                                                                       600
Bra. It is too true an euill. Gone she is,                             601
And what's to come of my despised time,                                602
Is naught but bitternesse. Now Rodorigo,                               603
Where didst thou see her? (Oh vnhappie Girle)                          604
With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?)                    605
How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me                     606
Past thought:) what said she to you? Get moe Tapers.                   607
Raise all my Kindred. Are they married thinke you?                     608
Rodo. Truely I thinke they are                                         609
                                                                       610
Bra. Oh Heauen: how got she out?                                       611
Oh treason of the blood.                                               612
Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds                     613
By what you see them act. Is there not Charmes,                        614
By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood                          615
May be abus'd? Haue you not read Rodorigo,                             616
Of some such thing?                                                    617
Rod. Yes Sir: I haue indeed                                            618
                                                                       619
Bra. Call vp my Brother: oh would you had had her.                     620
Some one way, some another. Doe you know                               621
Where we may apprehend her, and the Moore?                             622
Rod. I thinke I can discouer him, if you please                        623
To get good Guard, and go along with me                                624
                                                                       625
Bra. Pray you lead on. At euery house Ile call,                        626
(I may command at most) get Weapons (hoa)                              627
And raise some speciall Officers of might:                             628
On good Rodorigo, I will deserue your paines.                          629
                                                                       630
Exeunt.                                                                631
                                                                       632
                                                                       633
Scena Secunda.                                                         634
                                                                       635
Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.                         636
                                                                       637
Ia. Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men,                    638
Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th' conscience                          639
To do no contriu'd Murder: I lacke Iniquitie                           640
Sometime to do me seruice. Nine, or ten times                          641
I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes                  642
                                                                       643
Othello. 'Tis better as it is                                          644
                                                                       645
Iago. Nay but he prated,                                               646
And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes                            647
Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue             648
I did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir,                      649
Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,                              650
That the Magnifico is much belou'd,                                    651
And hath in his effect a voice potentiall                              652
As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.                           653
Or put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance,                          654
The Law (with all his might, to enforce it on)                         655
Will giue him Cable                                                    656
                                                                       657
Othel. Let him do his spight;                                          658
My Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie                            659
Shall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,                     660
Which when I know, that boasting is an Honour,                         661
I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,                         662
From Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites                             663
May speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune                         664
As this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago,                            665
But that I loue the gentle Desdemona,                                  666
I would not my vnhoused free condition                                 667
Put into Circumscription, and Confine,                                 668
For the Seas worth. But looke, what Lights come yond?                  669
                                                                       670
Enter Cassio, with Torches.                                            671

Iago. Those are the raised Father, and his Friends:                    673
You were best go in                                                    674

Othel. Not I: I must be found.                                         676
My Parts, my Title, and my perfect Soule                               677
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?                                 678
Iago. By Ianus, I thinke no                                            679
                                                                       680
Othel. The Seruants of the Dukes?                                      681
And my Lieutenant?                                                     682
The goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends)                          683
What is the Newes?                                                     684
Cassio. The Duke do's greet you (Generall)                             685
And he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance,                     686
Euen on the instant                                                    687
                                                                       688
Othello. What is the matter, thinke you?                               689
Cassio. Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine:                        690
It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies                           691
Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers                                   692
This very night, at one anothers heeles:                               693
And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,                               694
Are at the Dukes already. You haue bin hotly call'd for,               695
When being not at your Lodging to be found,                            696
The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests,                      697
To search you out                                                      698
                                                                       699
Othel. 'Tis well I am found by you:                                    700
I will but spend a word here in the house,                             701
And goe with you                                                       702

Cassio. Aunciant, what makes he heere?                                 704
Iago. Faith, he to night hath boarded a Land Carract,                  705
If it proue lawfull prize, he's made for euer                          706
                                                                       707
Cassio. I do not vnderstand                                            708
                                                                       709
Iago. He's married                                                     710
                                                                       711
Cassio. To who?                                                        712
Iago. Marry to- Come Captaine, will you go?                            713
Othel. Haue with you                                                   714
                                                                       715
Cassio. Here comes another Troope to seeke for you.                    716
                                                                       717
Enter Brabantio, Rodorigo, with Officers, and Torches.                 718
                                                                       719
Iago. It is Brabantio: Generall be aduis'd,                            720
He comes to bad intent                                                 721
                                                                       722
Othello. Holla, stand there                                            723
                                                                       724
Rodo. Signior, it is the Moore                                         725
                                                                       726
Bra. Downe with him, Theefe                                            727
                                                                       728
Iago. You, Rodorigo? Come Sir, I am for you                            729
                                                                       730
Othe. Keepe vp your bright Swords, for the dew will                    731
rust them. Good Signior, you shall more command with                   732
yeares, then with your Weapons                                         733
                                                                       734
Bra. Oh thou foule Theefe,                                             735
Where hast thou stow'd my Daughter?                                    736
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her                           737
For Ile referre me to all things of sense,                             738
(If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound)                           739
Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,                          740
So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd                               741
The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,                            742
Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)                          743
Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,                            744
Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?                     745
Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,                       746
That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,                    747
Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,                     748
That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,                           749
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;                               750
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,                              751
For an abuser of the World, a practiser                                752
Of Arts inhibited, and out of warrant;                                 753
Lay hold vpon him, if he do resist                                     754
Subdue him, at his perill                                              755
                                                                       756
Othe. Hold your hands                                                  757
Both you of my inclining, and the rest.                                758
Were it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it                       759
Without a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe                        760
To answere this your charge?                                           761
Bra. To Prison, till fit time                                          762
Of Law, and course of direct Session                                   763
Call thee to answer                                                    764

Othe. What if I do obey?                                               766
How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,                               767
Whose Messengers are heere about my side,                              768
Vpon some present businesse of the State,                              769
To bring me to him                                                     770
                                                                       771
Officer. 'Tis true most worthy Signior,                                772
The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,                           773
I am sure is sent for                                                  774
                                                                       775
Bra. How? The Duke in Counsell?                                        776
In this time of the night? Bring him away;                             777
Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,                           778
Or any of my Brothers of the State,                                    779
Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:                     780
For if such Actions may haue passage free,                             781

Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.                                    788

That giues them Credite                                                791

2.Sena. And mine two Hundred:                                          798
But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt,                           799
(As in these Cases where the ayme reports,                             800
'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme                     801

Duke. Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement:                         804
I do not so secure me in the Error,                                    805

By Signior Angelo                                                      818
                                                                       819
Duke. How say you by this change?                                      820
1.Sen. This cannot be                                                  821
By no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant                                  822
To keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider                            823
Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;                                824
And let our selues againe but vnderstand,                              825
That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,                       826
So may he with more facile question beare it,                          827
For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,                        828
But altogether lackes th' abilities                                    829
That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,                 830
We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,                        831
To leaue that latest, which concernes him first,                       832
Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine                               833
To wake, and wage a danger profitlesse                                 834
                                                                       835
Duke. Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes                       836
                                                                       837
Officer. Here is more Newes.                                           838
                                                                       839
Enter a Messenger.                                                     840
                                                                       841
Messen. The Ottamites, Reueren'd, and Gracious,                        842

1.Sen. I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse?                       846
Mess. Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re-stem                        847
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance                   848
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,                         849
Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour,                               850
With his free dutie, recommends you thus,                              851
And prayes you to beleeue him                                          852
                                                                       853
Duke. 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus:                                   854
Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne?                                    855
1.Sen. He's now in Florence                                            856
                                                                       857
Duke. Write from vs,                                                   858
To him, Post, Post-haste, dispatch                                     859
                                                                       860
1.Sen. Here comes Brabantio, and the Valiant Moore.                    861
                                                                       862
Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo, and Officers.        863
                                                                       864
Duke. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,                    865
Against the generall Enemy Ottoman.                                    866
I did not see you: welcome gentle Signior,                             867
We lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night                      868
                                                                       869
Bra. So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me.                        870
Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse                       871
Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care                 872
Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe                              873
Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,                           874
That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,                         875
And it is still it selfe                                               876
                                                                       877
Duke. Why? What's the matter?                                          878
Bra. My Daughter: oh my Daughter!                                      879
Sen. Dead?                                                             880
Bra. I, to me.                                                         881
She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted                           882
By Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks;                        883
For Nature, so prepostrously to erre,                                  884
(Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,)                        885
Sans witch-craft could not                                             886
                                                                       887
Duke. Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding                     888
Hath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe,                         889
And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,                              890
You shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter,                       891
After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son                      892
Stood in your Action                                                   893
                                                                       894
Bra. Humbly I thanke your Grace,                                       895
Here is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes                        896
Your speciall Mandate, for the State affaires                          897
Hath hither brought                                                    898
                                                                       899
All. We are verie sorry for't                                          900
                                                                       901
Duke. What in your owne part, can you say to this?                     902
Bra. Nothing, but this is so                                           903
                                                                       904
Othe. Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors,                      905
My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;                              906
That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,                          907
It is most true: true I haue married her;                              908
The verie head, and front of my offending,                             909
Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,                    910
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;                      911
For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,                  912
Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd                      913
Their deerest action, in the Tented Field:                             914
And little of this great world can I speake,                           915
More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,                 916
And therefore little shall I grace my cause,                           917
In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)             918
I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,                              919
Of my whole course of Loue.                                            920
What Drugges, what Charmes,                                            921
What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,                             922
(For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)                             923
I won his Daughter                                                     924
                                                                       925
Bra. A Maiden, neuer bold:                                             926
Of Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion                         927
Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,                    928
Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing                            929
To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;                     930
It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.                          931
That will confesse Perfection so could erre                            932
Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen                        933
To find out practises of cunning hell                                  934
Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe,                          935
That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,                     936
Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)                           937
He wrought vpon her.                                                   938
To vouch this, is no proofe,                                           939
Without more wider, and more ouer Test                                 940
Then these thin habits, and poore likely-hoods                         941
Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him                              942
                                                                       943
Sen. But Othello, speake,                                              944
Did you, by indirect, and forced courses                               945
Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?                        946
Or came it by request, and such faire question                         947
As soule, to soule affordeth?                                          948
Othel. I do beseech you,                                               949
Send for the Lady to the Sagitary,                                     950
And let her speake of me before her Father;                            951
If you do finde me foule, in her report,                               952
The Trust, the Office, I do hold of you,                               953
Not onely take away, but let your Sentence                             954
Euen fall vpon my life                                                 955
                                                                       956
Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither                                           957
                                                                       958
Othe. Aunciant, conduct them:                                          959
You best know the place.                                               960
And tell she come, as truely as to heauen,                             961
I do confesse the vices of my blood,                                   962
So iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present                             963
How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue,                            964
And she in mine                                                        965
                                                                       966
Duke. Say it Othello                                                   967
                                                                       968
Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:                             969
Still question'd me the Storie of my life,                             970
From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,                    971
That I haue past.                                                      972
I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,                           973
Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it.                              974
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:                            975
Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,                                976
Of haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;                  977
Of being taken by the Insolent Foe,                                    978
And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,                          979
And portance in my Trauellours historie.                               980
Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,                              981
Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,                 982
It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,                        983
And of the Canibals that each others eate,                             984
The Antropophague, and men whose heads                                 985
Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,                   986
Would Desdemona seriously incline:                                     987
But still the house Affaires would draw her hence:                     988
Which euer as she could with haste dispatch,                           989
She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare                           990
Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,                            991
Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes                       992
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,                            993
That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,                                 994
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,                            995
But not instinctiuely: I did consent,                                  996
And often did beguile her of her teares,                               997
When I did speake of some distressefull stroke                         998
That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,                          999
She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:                          1000
She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,              1001
'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.                            1002
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd                       1003
That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,                  1004
And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,                         1005
I should but teach him how to tell my Story,                          1006
And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,                      1007
She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,                              1008
And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.                             1009
This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd.                            1010
Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.                            1011
                                                                      1012
Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.                                    1013
                                                                      1014
Duke. I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too,                   1015
Good Brabantio, take vp this mangled matter at the best:              1016
Men do their broken Weapons rather vse,                               1017
Then their bare hands                                                 1018
                                                                      1019
Bra. I pray you heare her speake?                                     1020
If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer,                         1021
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame                               1022
Light on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris,                         1023
Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie,                           1024
Where most you owe obedience?                                         1025
Des. My Noble Father,                                                 1026
I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie.                                  1027
To you I am bound for life, and education:                            1028
My life and education both do learne me,                              1029
How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,                         1030
I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;                  1031
And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd                                1032
To you, preferring you before her Father:                             1033
So much I challenge, that I may professe                              1034
Due to the Moore my Lord                                              1035
                                                                      1036
Bra. God be with you: I haue done.                                    1037
Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;                       1038
I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.                           1039
Come hither Moore;                                                    1040
I here do giue thee that with all my heart,                           1041
Which but thou hast already, with all my heart                        1042
I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)                       1043
I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,                            1044
For thy escape would teach me Tirranie                                1045
To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord                          1046
                                                                      1047
Duke. Let me speake like your selfe:                                  1048
And lay a Sentence,                                                   1049
Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.                     1050
When remedies are past, the griefes are ended                         1051
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.                    1052
To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,                           1053
Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.                             1054
What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:                         1055
Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.                                 1056
The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,             1057
He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe                     1058
                                                                      1059
Bra. So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,                           1060
We loose it not so long as we can smile:                              1061
He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,                     1062
But the free comfort which from thence he heares.                     1063
But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,                      1064
That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.                    1065
These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,                                1066
Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.                           1067
But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:                           1068
That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.                 1069
I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State                 1070
                                                                      1071
Duke. The Turke with a most mighty Preparation                        1072
makes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is              1073
best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute             1074
of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more                     1075
soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer                   1076
voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber                1077
the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne,            1078
and boystrous expedition                                              1079
                                                                      1080
Othe. The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,                        1081
Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre                        1082
My thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize                            1083
A Naturall and prompt Alacratie,                                      1084
I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake                                1085
This present Warres against the Ottamites.                            1086
Most humbly therefore bending to your State,                          1087
I craue fit disposition for my Wife,                                  1088
Due reference of Place, and Exhibition,                               1089
With such Accomodation and besort                                     1090
As leuels with her breeding                                           1091
                                                                      1092
Duke. Why at her Fathers?                                             1093
Bra. I will not haue it so                                            1094
                                                                      1095
Othe. Nor I                                                           1096
                                                                      1097
Des. Nor would I there recide,                                        1098
To put my Father in impatient thoughts                                1099
By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,                              1100
To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,                           1101
And let me finde a Charter in your voice                              1102
T' assist my simplenesse                                              1103
                                                                      1104
Duke. What would you Desdemona?                                       1105
Des. That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,                         1106
My downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes,                      1107
May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd                          1108
Euen to the very quality of my Lord;                                  1109
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,                                   1110
And to his Honours and his valiant parts,                             1111
Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.                               1112
So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind                             1113
A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,                              1114
The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:                          1115
And I a heauie interim shall support                                  1116
By his deere absence. Let me go with him                              1117
                                                                      1118
Othe. Let her haue your voice.                                        1119
Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not                          1120
To please the pallate of my Appetite:                                 1121
Nor to comply with heat the yong affects                              1122
In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.                               1123
But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:                           1124
And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke                   1125
I will your serious and great businesse scant                         1126
When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes                      1127
Of feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse                        1128
My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:                               1129
That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:                     1130
Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,                           1131
And all indigne, and base aduersities,                                1132
Make head against my Estimation                                       1133
                                                                      1134
Duke. Be it as you shall priuately determine,                         1135
Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast:                1136
And speed must answer it                                              1137
                                                                      1138
Sen. You must away to night                                           1139
                                                                      1140
Othe. With all my heart                                               1141
                                                                      1142
Duke. At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.                 1143
Othello, leaue some Officer behind                                    1144
And he shall our Commission bring to you:                             1145
And such things else of qualitie and respect                          1146
As doth import you                                                    1147
                                                                      1148
Othe. So please your Grace, my Ancient,                               1149
A man he is of honesty and trust:                                     1150
To his conueyance I assigne my wife,                                  1151
With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think                  1152
To be sent after me                                                   1153
                                                                      1154
Duke. Let it be so:                                                   1155
Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior,                           1156
If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,                                 1157
Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke                       1158
                                                                      1159
Sen. Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well                            1160
                                                                      1161
Bra. Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:                   1162
She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.                           1163
Enter.                                                                1164
                                                                      1165
Othe. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago,                            1166
My Desdemona must I leaue to thee:                                    1167
I prythee let thy wife attend on her,                                 1168
And bring them after in the best aduantage.                           1169
Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre                                   1170
Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction                              1171
To spend with thee. We must obey the time.                            1172
Enter.                                                                1173
                                                                      1174
Rod. Iago                                                             1175
                                                                      1176
Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?                                    1177
Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?                                   1178
Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe                                        1179
                                                                      1180
Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe                             1181
                                                                      1182
Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why               1183
thou silly Gentleman?                                                 1184
Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:               1185
and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is                 1186
our Physition                                                         1187
                                                                      1188
Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world                      1189
for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish           1190
betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that             1191
knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would                   1192
drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would                 1193
change my Humanity with a Baboone                                     1194
                                                                      1195
Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame                      1196
to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it                 1197
                                                                      1198
Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are                 1199
thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,              1200
our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,            1201
or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:                       1202
Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with            1203
many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured           1204
with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie              1205
of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues                 1206
had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,         1207
the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would                         1208
conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we                    1209
haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall                  1210
Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you              1211
call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen                                     1212
                                                                      1213
Rod. It cannot be                                                     1214
                                                                      1215
Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission              1216
of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown                  1217
Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,                1218
and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of               1219
perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee                1220
then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the                     1221
Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say              1222
put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona              1223
should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in                   1224
thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement           1225
in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,               1226
put but Money in thy purse. These Moores                              1227
are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.              1228
The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,                   1229
shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She                 1230
must change for youth: when she is sated with his body                1231
she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money          1232
in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do                  1233
it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money              1234
thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt                 1235
an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be                     1236
not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou             1237
shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning              1238
thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather             1239
to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be                        1240
drown'd, and go without her                                           1241
                                                                      1242
Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on                   1243
the issue?                                                            1244
Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue                      1245
told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I             1246
hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse              1247
reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against                 1248
him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a                 1249
pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the                    1250
Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,                   1251
prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.               1252
Adieu                                                                 1253
                                                                      1254
Rod. Where shall we meete i'th' morning?                              1255
Iago. At my Lodging                                                   1256
                                                                      1257
Rod. Ile be with thee betimes                                         1258
                                                                      1259
Iago. Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo?                        1260
Rod. Ile sell all my Land.                                            1261
Enter.                                                                1262
                                                                      1263
Iago. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:                         1264
For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane                      1265
If I would time expend with such Snipe,                               1266
But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,                       1267
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets                       1268
She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,                     1269
But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,                             1270
Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,                          1271
The better shall my purpose worke on him:                             1272
Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now,                                1273
To get his Place, and to plume vp my will                             1274
In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.                               1275
After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,                            1276
That he is too familiar with his wife:                                1277
He hath a person, and a smooth dispose                                1278
To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.                          1279
The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,                              1280
That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,                     1281
And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose                              1282
As Asses are:                                                         1283
I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,                            1284
Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.                 1285
                                                                      1286
Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.                                          1287
                                                                      1288
Enter Montano, and two Gentlemen.                                     1289
                                                                      1290
Mon. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?                     1291
1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:                   1292
I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,                            1293
Descry a Saile                                                        1294
                                                                      1295
Mon. Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,                    1296
A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:                          1297
If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,                                  1298
What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,                    1299
Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?                    1300
2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:                                 1301
For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,                              1302
The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,                         1303
The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high & monstrous Maine                   1304
Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare,                            1305
And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:                         1306
I neuer did like mollestation view                                    1307
On the enchafed Flood                                                 1308
                                                                      1309
Men. If that the Turkish Fleete                                       1310
Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,                    1311
It is impossible to beare it out.                                     1312
Enter a Gentleman.                                                    1313
                                                                      1314
3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:                                  1315
The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,                      1316
That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,                 1317
Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance                           1318
On most part of their Fleet                                           1319
                                                                      1320
Mon. How? Is this true?                                               1321
3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio              1322
Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello,                             1323
Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,                          1324
And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus                            1325
                                                                      1326
Mon. I am glad on't:                                                  1327
'Tis a worthy Gouernour                                               1328
                                                                      1329
3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort,                  1330
Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,                      1331
And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted                     1332
With fowle and violent Tempest                                        1333
                                                                      1334
Mon. Pray Heauens he be:                                              1335
For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands                           1336
Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)                      1337
As well to see the Vessell that's come in,                            1338
As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,                           1339
Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,                     1340
An indistinct regard                                                  1341
                                                                      1342
Gent. Come, let's do so;                                              1343
For euery Minute is expectancie                                       1344
Of more Arriuancie.                                                   1345
Enter Cassio.                                                         1346
                                                                      1347
Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,                  1348
That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens                        1349
Giue him defence against the Elements,                                1350
For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea                                1351
                                                                      1352
Mon. Is he well ship'd?                                               1353
Cassio. His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot                  1354
Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;                              1355
Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)                          1356
Stand in bold Cure                                                    1357
                                                                      1358

Cassio. What noise?                                                   1361
Gent. The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea                       1362
Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile                          1363
                                                                      1364
Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor                        1365
                                                                      1366
Gent. They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,                      1367
Our Friends, at least                                                 1368
                                                                      1369
Cassio. I pray you Sir, go forth,                                     1370
And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd                            1371

                                                                      1375
Mon. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?                     1376
Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid                    1377
That paragons description, and wilde Fame:                            1378
One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,                        1379

How now? Who ha's put in?                                             1384

Cassio. Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:                   1387
Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,                   1388
The gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands,                           1389
Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,                 1390
As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit                                   1391

Mon. What is she?                                                     1395
Cassio. She that I spake of:                                          1396
Our great Captains Captaine,                                          1397

Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,                                    1415
What tydings can you tell of my Lord?                                 1416

Des. Oh, but I feare:                                                 1420
How lost you company?                                                 1421
Cassio. The great Contention of Sea, and Skies                        1422
Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile                            1423
                                                                      1424

This likewise is a Friend                                             1428
                                                                      1429
Cassio. See for the Newes:                                            1430
Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:                       1431
Let it not gaule your patience (good Iago)                            1432
That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,                           1433
That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie                              1434
                                                                      1435
Iago. Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,                  1436
As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,                              1437
You would haue enough                                                 1438
                                                                      1439
Des. Alas: she ha's no speech                                         1440
                                                                      1441
Iago. Infaith too much:                                               1442
I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.                        1443
Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,                                  1444
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,                            1445
And chides with thinking                                              1446
                                                                      1447
aemil. You haue little cause to say so                                1448
                                                                      1449
Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of                       1450
doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens:           1451
Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:                       1452
Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your                      1453
Beds                                                                  1454
                                                                      1455
Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer                                     1456
                                                                      1457
Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,                          1458
You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.                             1459
Aemil. You shall not write my praise                                  1460
                                                                      1461
Iago. No, let me not                                                  1462
                                                                      1463
Desde. What would'st write of me, if thou should'st                   1464
praise me?                                                            1465
Iago. Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,                           1466
For I am nothing, if not Criticall                                    1467
                                                                      1468
Des. Come on, assay.                                                  1469
There's one gone to the Harbour?                                      1470
Iago. I Madam                                                         1471
                                                                      1472
Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile                                 1473
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.                                 1474
Come, how would'st thou praise me?                                    1475
Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes                    1476
from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes                1477
out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she                1478
is deliuer'd.                                                         1479
If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit,                       1480
The ones for vse, the other vseth it                                  1481
                                                                      1482
Des. Well prais'd:                                                    1483
How if she be Blacke and Witty?                                       1484
Iago. If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit,                       1485
She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit                    1486
                                                                      1487
Des. Worse, and worse.                                                1488
Aemil. How if Faire, and Foolish?                                     1489
Iago. She neuer yet was foolish that was faire,                       1490
For euen her folly helpt her to an heire                              1491
                                                                      1492
Desde. These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles                   1493
laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou                 1494
for her that's Foule, and Foolish                                     1495
                                                                      1496
Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,                    1497
But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do                  1498
                                                                      1499
Desde. Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst                    1500
best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing             1501
woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her                      1502
merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it                  1503
selfe                                                                 1504
                                                                      1505
Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,                       1506
Had Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud:                           1507
Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay,                             1508
Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may.                           1509
She that being angred, her reuenge being nie,                         1510
Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:                         1511
She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,                             1512
To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile:                        1513
She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,                   1514
See Suitors following, and not looke behind:                          1515
She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)                          1516
Des. To do what?                                                      1517
Iago. To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere                     1518
                                                                      1519
Desde. Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do                       1520
not learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband.                 1521
How say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall          1522
Counsailor?                                                           1523
Cassio. He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish                       1524
him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler                        1525
                                                                      1526
Iago. He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper.               1527
With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great                 1528
a Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee               1529
in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.                1530
If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,          1531
it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers             1532
so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play                     1533
the Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie:           1534
'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your                      1535
lippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your                        1536
sake.                                                                 1537
The Moore I know his Trumpet                                          1538
                                                                      1539
Cassio. 'Tis truely so                                                1540
                                                                      1541
Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him                                 1542
                                                                      1543
Cassio. Loe, where he comes.                                          1544
Enter Othello, and Attendants.                                        1545
                                                                      1546
Oth. O, my faire Warriour                                             1547
                                                                      1548
Des. My deere Othello                                                 1549
                                                                      1550
Othe. It giues me wonder great, as my content                         1551
To see you heere before me.                                           1552
Oh my Soules Ioy:                                                     1553
If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,                             1554
May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:                    1555
And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas                      1556
Olympus high: and duck againe as low,                                 1557
As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,                         1558
'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,                             1559
My Soule hath her content so absolute,                                1560
That not another comfort like to this,                                1561
Succeedes in vnknowne Fate                                            1562
                                                                      1563
Des. The Heauens forbid                                               1564
But that our Loues                                                    1565
And Comforts should encrease                                          1566
Euen as our dayes do grow                                             1567
                                                                      1568
Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)                                     1569
I cannot speake enough of this content,                               1570
It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.                           1571
And this, and this the greatest discords be                           1572
That ere our hearts shall make                                        1573
                                                                      1574
Iago. Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe                    1575
the peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am                   1576
                                                                      1577
Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.                                     1578
Newes (Friends) our Warres are done:                                  1579
The Turkes are drown'd.                                               1580
How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?                            1581
(Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,                           1582
I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,                   1583
I prattle out of fashion, and I doate                                 1584
In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,                          1585
Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:                             1586
Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,                               1587
He is a good one, and his worthynesse                                 1588
Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,                          1589
Once more well met at Cyprus.                                         1590
                                                                      1591
Exit Othello and Desdemona.                                           1592
                                                                      1593
Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.                       1594
Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men            1595
being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,                1596
more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to               1597
night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell               1598
thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him                    1599
                                                                      1600
Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible                                 1601
                                                                      1602
Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.           1603
Marke me with what violence she first lou'd                           1604
the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall             1605
lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet             1606
heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight                1607
shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood                 1608
is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a                 1609
game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.             1610
Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,                   1611
and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now                1612
for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate                 1613
tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,            1614
gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil              1615
instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.            1616
Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd          1617
position) who stands so eminent in the degree of                      1618
this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no                1619
further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme              1620
of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse               1621
of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,               1622
why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:          1623
that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,              1624
though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.                         1625
A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:              1626
and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene           1627
mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the               1628
woman hath found him already                                          1629
                                                                      1630
Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most                1631
bless'd condition                                                     1632
                                                                      1633
Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is                     1634
made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would                 1635
neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou               1636
not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not              1637
marke that?                                                           1638
Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie                       1639
                                                                      1640
Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure                  1641
prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.                   1642
They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes              1643
embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when                  1644
these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand                  1645
comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate                 1646
conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue                 1647
brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for                      1648
the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you                    1649
not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion            1650
to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or                      1651
tainting his discipline, or from what other course                    1652
you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister              1653
                                                                      1654
Rod. Well                                                             1655
                                                                      1656
Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and                1657
happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for               1658
euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.              1659
Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,             1660
but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you                        1661
haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I               1662
shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment                  1663
most profitably remoued, without the which there were                 1664
no expectation of our prosperitie                                     1665
                                                                      1666
Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity          1667
                                                                      1668
Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the                       1669
Cittadell. I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore. Farewell             1670
                                                                      1671
Rodo. Adieu.                                                          1672
Enter.                                                                1673
                                                                      1674
Iago. That Cassio loues her, I do well beleeu't:                      1675
That she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite.                   1676
The Moore (howbeit that I endure him not)                             1677
Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,                               1678
And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona                           1679
A most deere husband. Now I do loue her too,                          1680
Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture                        1681
I stand accomptant for as great a sin)                                1682
But partely led to dyet my Reuenge,                                   1683
For that I do suspect the lustie Moore                                1684
Hath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof,                       1685
Doth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes:                    1686
And nothing can, or shall content my Soule                            1687
Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.                           1688
Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,                              1689
At least into a Ielouzie so strong                                    1690
That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,                        1691
If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace                           1692
For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,                         1693
Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,                               1694
Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe                            1695
(For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too)                           1696
Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,                     1697
For making him egregiously an Asse,                                   1698
And practising vpon his peace, and quiet,                             1699
Euen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd,                       1700
Knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.                     1701
Enter.                                                                1702
                                                                      1703
                                                                      1704
Scena Secunda.                                                        1705
                                                                      1706
Enter Othello's Herald with a Proclamation.                           1707

Herald. It is Othello's pleasure, our Noble and Valiant               1709
Generall. That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd,                     1710

Reuels his addition leads him. For besides these beneficiall          1714
Newes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So                      1715
much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices               1716
are open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this              1717
present houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen.                1718
Blesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall Othello.            1719
Enter.                                                                1720
                                                                      1721
Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.                     1722
                                                                      1723
Othe. Good Michael, looke you to the guard to night.                  1724
Let's teach our selues that Honourable stop,                          1725
Not to out-sport discretion                                           1726
                                                                      1727
Cas. Iago, hath direction what to do.                                 1728
But notwithstanding with my personall eye                             1729
Will I looke to't                                                     1730
                                                                      1731
Othe. Iago, is most honest:                                           1732
Michael, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest,                     1733
Let me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue,                      1734
The purchase made, the fruites are to ensue,                          1735
That profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you.                        1736
Goodnight.                                                            1737
Enter.                                                                1738
                                                                      1739
Enter Iago.                                                           1740
                                                                      1741
Cas. Welcome Iago: we must to the Watch                               1742
                                                                      1743
Iago. Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten                     1744
o'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the                1745
loue of his Desdemona: Who, let vs not therefore blame;               1746
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and                   1747
she is sport for Ioue                                                 1748
                                                                      1749
Cas. She's a most exquisite Lady                                      1750
                                                                      1751
Iago. And Ile warrant her, full of Game                               1752
                                                                      1753
Cas. Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature                   1754
                                                                      1755
Iago. What an eye she ha's?                                           1756
Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation                          1757
                                                                      1758
Cas. An inuiting eye:                                                 1759
And yet me thinkes right modest                                       1760
                                                                      1761
Iago. And when she speakes,                                           1762
Is it not an Alarum to Loue?                                          1763
Cas. She is indeed perfection                                         1764

I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a                       1767

Cas. Not to night, good Iago, I haue very poore,                      1771
and vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish                  1772
Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment             1773
                                                                      1774

Cassio. I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that                  1778
was craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation                 1779
it makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and                1780

Cas. Where are they?                                                  1786
Iago. Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in                    1787

Cas. Ile do't, but it dislikes me.                                    1789
Enter.                                                                1790

Iago. If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him                            1792
With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie,                     1793
He'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence                              1794
As my yong Mistris dogge.                                             1795
Now my sicke Foole Rodorigo,                                          1796

The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle)                             1802
Haue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups,                          1803
And they Watch too.                                                   1804
Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards                                  1805
Am I put to our Cassio in some Action                                 1806
That may offend the Isle. But here they come.                         1807
Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen.                                 1808

And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:                               1819
And let me the Cannakin clinke.                                       1820
A Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span,                        1821

                                                                      1826
Iago. I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are                  1827
most potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine,                     1828
and your swag-belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are                     1829
nothing to your English                                               1830
                                                                      1831
Cassio. Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking?              1832
Iago. Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane                  1833
dead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine.                1834
He giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next                         1835
Pottle can be fill'd                                                  1836

Iago. Oh sweet England.                                               1842
King Stephen was anda worthy Peere,                                   1843
His Breeches cost him but a Crowne,                                   1844
He held them Six pence all to deere,                                  1845
With that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne:                                  1846
He was a wight of high Renowne,                                       1847
And thou art but of low degree:                                       1848
'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe,                              1849

Some Wine hoa                                                         1851

Cassio. Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other              1853
                                                                      1854
Iago. Will you heare't againe?                                        1855
Cas. No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place,                  1856
that do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and                  1857
there be soules must be saued, and there be soules must               1858

Iago. It's true, good Lieutenant                                      1861
                                                                      1862
Cas. For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall,                  1863
nor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued                           1864
                                                                      1865
Iago. And so do I too Lieutenant                                      1866
                                                                      1867
Cassio. I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The                     1868
Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue              1869
no more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our                1870
sinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not                1871
thinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this               1872
is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke                1873
now: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough                1874
                                                                      1875
Gent. Excellent well                                                  1876
                                                                      1877
Cas. Why very well then: you must not thinke then,                    1878
that I am drunke.                                                     1879
Enter.                                                                1880
                                                                      1881

                                                                      1884
Iago. You see this Fellow, that is gone before,                       1885
He's a Souldier, fit to stand by Caesar,                              1886
And giue direction. And do but see his vice,                          1887
'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox,                                   1888
The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him:                     1889
I feare the trust Othello puts him in,                                1890
On some odde time of his infirmitie                                   1891
Will shake this Island                                                1892
                                                                      1893
Mont. But is he often thus?                                           1894
Iago. 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe,                       1895
He'le watch the Horologe a double Set,                                1896
If Drinke rocke not his Cradle                                        1897
                                                                      1898
Mont. It were well                                                    1899
The Generall were put in mind of it:                                  1900
Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature                            1901
Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio,                            1902
And lookes not on his euills: is not this true?                       1903
Enter Rodorigo.                                                       1904
                                                                      1905
Iago. How now Rodorigo?                                               1906
I pray you after the Lieutenant, go                                   1907
                                                                      1908
Mon. And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore                       1909
Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second                        1910
With one of an ingraft Infirmitie,                                    1911
It were an honest Action, to say so                                   1912
To the Moore                                                          1913

Iago. Not I, for this faire Island,                                   1915
I do loue Cassio well: and would do much                              1916
To cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise?                    1917
Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo.                                       1918
                                                                      1919
Cas. You Rogue: you Rascall                                           1920
                                                                      1921
Mon. What's the matter Lieutenant?                                    1922
Cas. A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the                         1923
Knaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle                                          1924
                                                                      1925
Rod. Beate me?                                                        1926
Cas. Dost thou prate, Rogue?                                          1927
Mon. Nay, good Lieutenant:                                            1928
I pray you Sir, hold your hand                                        1929
                                                                      1930
Cassio. Let me go (Sir)                                               1931
Or Ile knocke you o're the Mazard                                     1932
                                                                      1933
Mon. Come, come: you're drunke                                        1934
                                                                      1935
Cassio. Drunke?                                                       1936
Iago. Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie.                           1937
Nay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen:                                  1938
Helpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir Montano:                                   1939
Helpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed.                         1940
Who's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa:                         1941
The Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant,                             1942
You'le be asham'd for euer.                                           1943
Enter Othello, and Attendants.                                        1944
                                                                      1945
Othe. What is the matter heere?                                       1946
Mon. I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies                   1947
                                                                      1948
Othe. Hold for your liues                                             1949
                                                                      1950
Iag. Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir Montano, Gentlemen:                    1951
Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie?                         1952
Hold. The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame                      1953
                                                                      1954
Oth. Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?                       1955
Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that                       1956
Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes.                              1957
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle:                    1958
He that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage,                       1959
Holds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion.                       1960
Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,                     1961
From her propriety. What is the matter, Masters?                      1962
Honest Iago, that lookes dead with greeuing,                          1963
Speake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee?                    1964
Iago. I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now.                  1965
In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome                      1966
Deuesting them for Bed: and then, but now:                            1967
(As if some Planet had vnwitted men)                                  1968
Swords out, and tilting one at others breastes,                       1969
In opposition bloody. I cannot speake                                 1970
Any begining to this peeuish oddes.                                   1971
And would, in Action glorious, I had lost                             1972
Those legges, that brought me to a part of it                         1973
                                                                      1974
Othe. How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot?                    1975
Cas. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake                            1976
                                                                      1977
Othe. Worthy Montano, you were wont to be ciuill:                     1978
The grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth                            1979
The world hath noted. And your name is great                          1980
In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter                       1981
That you vnlace your reputation thus,                                 1982
And spend your rich opinion, for the name                             1983
Of a night-brawler? Giue me answer to it                              1984
                                                                      1985
Mon. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,                             1986
Your Officer Iago, can informe you,                                   1987
While I spare speech which something now offends me.                  1988
Of all that I do know, nor know I ought                               1989
By me, that's said, or done amisse this night,                        1990
Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice,                           1991
And to defend our selues, it be a sinne                               1992
When violence assailes vs                                             1993
                                                                      1994
Othe. Now by Heauen,                                                  1995
My blood begins my safer Guides to rule,                              1996
And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)                        1997
Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,                             1998
Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you                             1999
Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know                             2000
How this foule Rout began: Who set it on,                             2001
And he that is approu'd in this offence,                              2002
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,                       2003
Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,                             2004
Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare,                     2005
To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?                           2006
In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?                      2007
'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't?                                    2008
Mon. If partially Affin'd, or league in office,                       2009
Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,                          2010
Thou art no Souldier                                                  2011
                                                                      2012
Iago. Touch me not so neere,                                          2013
I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,                      2014
Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio.                         2015
Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth                          2016
Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:                         2017
Montano and my selfe being in speech,                                 2018
There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,                           2019
And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword                        2020
To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,                             2021
Steppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:                         2022
My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,                               2023
Least by his clamour (as it so fell out)                              2024
The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)                  2025
Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather                        2026
For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,                      2027
And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night                          2028
I nere might say before. When I came backe                            2029
(For this was briefe) I found them close together                     2030
At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were                         2031
When you your selfe did part them.                                    2032
More of this matter cannot I report,                                  2033
But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,                           2034
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,                           2035
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,                      2036
Yet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd                                 2037
From him that fled, some strange Indignitie,                          2038
Which patience could not passe                                        2039
                                                                      2040
Othe. I know Iago                                                     2041
Thy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter,                        2042
Making it light to Cassio: Cassio, I loue thee,                       2043
But neuer more be Officer of mine.                                    2044
Enter Desdemona attended.                                             2045
                                                                      2046
Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp:                             2047
Ile make thee an example                                              2048
                                                                      2049
Des. What is the matter (Deere?)                                      2050
Othe. All's well, Sweeting:                                           2051
Come away to bed. Sir for your hurts,                                 2052
My selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off:                          2053
Iago, looke with care about the Towne,                                2054
And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.                  2055
Come Desdemona, 'tis the Soldiers life,                               2056
To haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife.                       2057
Enter.                                                                2058
                                                                      2059
Iago. What are you hurt Lieutenant?                                   2060
Cas. I, past all Surgery                                              2061
                                                                      2062
Iago. Marry Heauen forbid                                             2063
                                                                      2064
Cas. Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue                    2065
lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of                 2066
myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,                2067
Iago, my Reputation                                                   2068
                                                                      2069
Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had                     2070
receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that               2071
then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false             2072
imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.        2073
You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you                       2074
repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are                  2075
more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are                    2076
but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,             2077
then in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse           2078
dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to                          2079
him againe, and he's yours                                            2080
                                                                      2081
Cas. I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue                2082
so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so               2083
indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And                 2084
squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian                      2085
with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of                    2086
Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call               2087
thee Diuell                                                           2088
                                                                      2089
Iago. What was he that you follow'd with your                         2090
Sword? What had he done to you?                                       2091
Cas. I know not                                                       2092
                                                                      2093
Iago. Is't possible?                                                  2094
Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:            2095
a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that                           2096
men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away             2097
their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,                    2098
reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts                2099
                                                                      2100
Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how                           2101
came you thus recouered?                                              2102
Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue                 2103
place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me              2104
another to make me frankly despise my selfe                           2105
                                                                      2106
Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the                     2107
Time, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands               2108
I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as        2109
it is, mend it for your owne good                                     2110
                                                                      2111
Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell               2112
me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,                  2113
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible              2114
man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh                     2115
strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient        2116
is a diuell                                                           2117
                                                                      2118
Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar                       2119
Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.            2120
And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue                      2121
you                                                                   2122
                                                                      2123
Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?                       2124
Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a                      2125
time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's                 2126
Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,             2127
for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the                2128
Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts                     2129
and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune              2130
her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is                     2131
of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,               2132
she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more                  2133
then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene                     2134
you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my                 2135
Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of                 2136
your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before                    2137
                                                                      2138
Cassio. You aduise me well                                            2139
                                                                      2140
Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest                 2141
kindnesse                                                             2142
                                                                      2143
Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,               2144
I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake                    2145
for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me                2146
                                                                      2147
Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I                  2148
must to the Watch                                                     2149
                                                                      2150
Cassio. Good night, honest Iago.                                      2151
                                                                      2152
Exit Cassio.                                                          2153
                                                                      2154
Iago. And what's he then,                                             2155
That saies I play the Villaine?                                       2156
When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,                          2157
Proball to thinking, and indeed the course                            2158
To win the Moore againe.                                              2159
For 'tis most easie                                                   2160
Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue                                     2161
In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull                       2162
As the free Elements. And then for her                                2163
To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,                      2164
All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:                              2165
His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,                               2166
That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,                          2167
Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,                              2168
With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,                    2169
To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,                           2170
Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,                              2171
When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,                          2172
They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,                        2173
As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole                             2174
Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,                              2175
And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,                       2176
Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:                              2177
That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,                           2178
And by how much she striues to do him good,                           2179
She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.                            2180
So will I turne her vertue into pitch.                                2181
And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,                           2182
That shall en-mash them all.                                          2183
How now Rodorigo?                                                     2184
Enter Rodorigo.                                                       2185
                                                                      2186
Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not                         2187
like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the                   2188
Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night                   2189
exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue                    2190
will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;              2191
And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne          2192
againe to Venice                                                      2193
                                                                      2194
Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?                      2195
What wound did euer heale but by degrees?                             2196
Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft                   2197
And Wit depends on dilatory time:                                     2198
Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,                           2199
And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:                    2200
Though other things grow faire against the Sun,                       2201
Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:                  2202
Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;                     2203
Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.                    2204
Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:                              2205
Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:                         2206
Nay get thee gone.                                                    2207
                                                                      2208
Exit Roderigo.                                                        2209
                                                                      2210
Two things are to be done:                                            2211
My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris:                          2212
Ile set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart,             2213
And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde                         2214
Soliciting his wife: I, that's the way:                               2215
Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.                             2216
Enter.                                                                2217
                                                                      2218
                                                                      2219
Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.                                           2220
                                                                      2221
Enter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne.                                  2222
                                                                      2223
Cassio. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,               2224
Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General                  2225
                                                                      2226
Clo. Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples,                2227
that they speake i'th' Nose thus?                                     2228

The Generall and his wife are talking of it,                          2290

What euer shall become of Michael Cassio,                             2339
He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant                            2340
                                                                      2341
Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:                     2342
You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd                     2343
He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,                        2344
Then in a politique distance                                          2345
                                                                      2346
Cassio. I, but Lady,                                                  2347
That policie may either last so long,                                 2348
Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,                            2349
Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,                           2350
That I being absent, and my place supply'd,                           2351
My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice                          2352
                                                                      2353

I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,                        2355
If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it                             2356
To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,                        2357
Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;                    2358
His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,                    2359
Ile intermingle euery thing he do's                                   2360
With Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio,                       2361
For thy Solicitor shall rather dye,                                   2362
Then giue thy cause away.                                             2363
Enter Othello, and Iago.                                              2364

Des. Why stay, and heare me speake                                    2370
                                                                      2371
Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,                        2372
Vnfit for mine owne purposes                                          2373
                                                                      2374
Des. Well, do your discretion.                                        2375
                                                                      2376
Exit Cassio.                                                          2377
                                                                      2378
Iago. Hah? I like not that                                            2379
                                                                      2380
Othel. What dost thou say?                                            2381
Iago. Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what                         2382
                                                                      2383
Othel. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?                       2384
Iago. Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it                     2385
That he would steale away so guilty-like,                             2386
Seeing your comming                                                   2387
                                                                      2388
Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he                                            2389
                                                                      2390
Des. How now my Lord?                                                 2391
I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,                               2392
A man that languishes in your displeasure                             2393
                                                                      2394
Oth. Who is't you meane?                                              2395
Des. Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord,                        2396
If I haue any grace, or power to moue you,                            2397
His present reconciliation take.                                      2398
For if he be not one, that truly loues you,                           2399
That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,                          2400
I haue no iudgement in an honest face.                                2401
I prythee call him backe                                              2402
                                                                      2403
Oth. Went he hence now?                                               2404
Des. I sooth; so humbled,                                             2405
That he hath left part of his greefe with mee                         2406
To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe                         2407
                                                                      2408
Othel. Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time                       2409
                                                                      2410
Des. But shall't be shortly?                                          2411
Oth. The sooner (Sweet) for you                                       2412
                                                                      2413
Des. Shall't be to night, at Supper?                                  2414
Oth. No, not to night                                                 2415
                                                                      2416
Des. To morrow Dinner then?                                           2417
Oth. I shall not dine at home:                                        2418
I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell                                2419
                                                                      2420
Des. Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,                      2421
On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.                         2422
I prythee name the time, but let it not                               2423
Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:                           2424
And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason                           2425
(Saue that they say the warres must make example)                     2426
Out of her best, is not almost a fault                                2427
T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?                      2428
Tell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule                                 2429
What you would aske me, that I should deny,                           2430
Or stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,                        2431
That came a woing with you? and so many a time                        2432
(When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)                              2433
Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do                            2434
To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much                            2435
                                                                      2436
Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:                      2437
I will deny thee nothing                                              2438
                                                                      2439
Des. Why, this is not a Boone:                                        2440
'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,                      2441
Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,                    2442
Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit                                2443
To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite                         2444
Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,                            2445
It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,                      2446
And fearefull to be granted                                           2447
                                                                      2448
Oth. I will deny thee nothing.                                        2449
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,                            2450
To leaue me but a little to my selfe                                  2451
                                                                      2452
Des. Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord                           2453
                                                                      2454
Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait                   2455
                                                                      2456
Des. aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you:                      2457
What ere you be, I am obedient.                                       2458
Enter.                                                                2459
                                                                      2460
Oth. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule                       2461
But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,                         2462
Chaos is come againe                                                  2463
                                                                      2464
Iago. My Noble Lord                                                   2465
                                                                      2466
Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?                                        2467
Iago. Did Michael Cassio                                              2468
When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?                             2469
Oth. He did, from first to last:                                      2470
Why dost thou aske?                                                   2471
Iago. But for a satisfaction of my Thought,                           2472
No further harme                                                      2473
                                                                      2474
Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?                                        2475
Iago. I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir                 2476
                                                                      2477
Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft                             2478
                                                                      2479
Iago. Indeed?                                                         2480
Oth. Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?                 2481
Is he not honest?                                                     2482
Iago. Honest, my Lord?                                                2483
Oth. Honest? I, Honest                                                2484
                                                                      2485
Iago. My Lord, for ought I know                                       2486
                                                                      2487
Oth. What do'st thou thinke?                                          2488
Iago. Thinke, my Lord?                                                2489
Oth. Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;                         2490
As if there were some Monster in thy thought                          2491
Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:                    2492
I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,                      2493
When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?                      2494
And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,                         2495
Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?                 2496
And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,                    2497
As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine                         2498
Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,                        2499
Shew me thy thought                                                   2500
                                                                      2501
Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you                                    2502
                                                                      2503
Oth. I thinke thou do'st:                                             2504
And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,                    2505
And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,                2506
Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:                   2507
For such things in a false disloyall Knaue                            2508
Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,                     2509
They're close dilations, working from the heart,                      2510
That Passion cannot rule                                              2511
                                                                      2512
Iago. For Michael Cassio,                                             2513
I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest                          2514
                                                                      2515
Oth. I thinke so too                                                  2516
                                                                      2517
Iago. Men should be what they seeme,                                  2518
Or those that be not, would they might seeme none                     2519
                                                                      2520
Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme                          2521
                                                                      2522
Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man                        2523
                                                                      2524
Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?                                   2525
I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,                          2526
As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts                 2527
The worst of words                                                    2528
                                                                      2529
Iago. Good my Lord pardon me,                                         2530
Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,                             2531
I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:                          2532
Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?                 2533
As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things                        2534
Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,                  2535
Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions                                       2536
Keepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit                      2537
With meditations lawfull?                                             2538
Oth. Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago)                    2539
If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare                 2540
A stranger to thy Thoughts                                            2541
                                                                      2542
Iago. I do beseech you,                                               2543
Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse                            2544
(As I confesse it is my Natures plague                                2545
To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie                               2546
Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome                        2547
From one, that so imperfectly conceits,                               2548
Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble                  2549
Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:                         2550
It were not for your quiet, nor your good,                            2551
Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,                            2552
To let you know my thoughts                                           2553
                                                                      2554
Oth. What dost thou meane?                                            2555
Iago. Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord)                       2556
Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;                              2557
Who steales my purse, steales trash:                                  2558
'Tis something, nothing;                                              2559
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:                 2560
But he that filches from me my good Name,                             2561
Robs me of that, which not enriches him,                              2562
And makes me poore indeed                                             2563
                                                                      2564
Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts                                            2565
                                                                      2566
Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,                      2567
Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie                            2568
                                                                      2569
Oth. Ha?                                                              2570
Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,                               2571
It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke                       2572
The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,                  2573
Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:                      2574
But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,                              2575
Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?                   2576
Oth. O miserie                                                        2577
                                                                      2578
Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,                   2579
But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,                          2580
To him that euer feares he shall be poore:                            2581
Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend                        2582
From Iealousie                                                        2583
                                                                      2584
Oth. Why? why is this?                                                2585
Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;                         2586
To follow still the changes of the Moone                              2587
With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,                       2588
Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,                            2589
When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule                          2590
To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,                             2591
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,                 2592
To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,                   2593
Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:                         2594
Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.                             2595
Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw                         2596
The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,                           2597
For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,                              2598
Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;                          2599
And on the proofe, there is no more but this,                         2600
Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie                                  2601
                                                                      2602
Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason                    2603
To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you                            2604
With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)                        2605
Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:                       2606
Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,                     2607
Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:                      2608
I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,                         2609
Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:                          2610
I know our Country disposition well:                                  2611
In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes                         2612
They dare not shew their Husbands.                                    2613
Their best Conscience,                                                2614
Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne                           2615
                                                                      2616
Oth. Dost thou say so?                                                2617
Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,                       2618
And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,                  2619
She lou'd them most                                                   2620
                                                                      2621
Oth. And so she did                                                   2622
                                                                      2623
Iago. Why go too then:                                                2624
Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming                      2625
To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,                          2626
He thought 'twas Witchcraft.                                          2627
But I am much too blame:                                              2628
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon                                2629
For too much louing you                                               2630
                                                                      2631
Oth. I am bound to thee for euer                                      2632
                                                                      2633
Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:                   2634
Oth. Not a iot, not a iot                                             2635
                                                                      2636
Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:                                       2637
I hope you will consider what is spoke                                2638
Comes from your Loue.                                                 2639
But I do see y'are moou'd:                                            2640
I am to pray you, not to straine my speech                            2641
To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,                               2642
Then to Suspition                                                     2643
                                                                      2644
Oth. I will not                                                       2645
                                                                      2646
Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)                                      2647
My speech should fall into such vilde successe,                       2648
Which my Thoughts aym'd not.                                          2649
Cassio's my worthy Friend:                                            2650
My Lord, I see y'are mou'd                                            2651
                                                                      2652
Oth. No, not much mou'd:                                              2653
I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest                                2654
                                                                      2655
Iago. Long liue she so;                                               2656
And long liue you to thinke so                                        2657
                                                                      2658
Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe                          2659
                                                                      2660
Iago. I, there's the point:                                           2661
As (to be bold with you)                                              2662
Not to affect many proposed Matches                                   2663
Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,                            2664
Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:                           2665
Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,                         2666
Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.                            2667
But (pardon me) I do not in position                                  2668
Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare                          2669
Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement,                          2670
May fal to match you with her Country formes,                         2671
And happily repent                                                    2672
                                                                      2673
Oth. Farewell, farewell:                                              2674
If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:                         2675
Set on thy wife to obserue.                                           2676
Leaue me Iago                                                         2677
                                                                      2678
Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue                                        2679
                                                                      2680
Othel. Why did I marry?                                               2681
This honest Creature (doubtlesse)                                     2682
Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds                      2683
                                                                      2684
Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor                     2685
To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,                      2686
Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;                         2687
For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;                          2688
Yet if you please, to him off a-while:                                2689
You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:                       2690
Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment                           2691
With any strong, or vehement importunitie,                            2692
Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,                        2693
Let me be thought too busie in my feares,                             2694
(As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)                                2695
And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor                            2696
                                                                      2697
Oth. Feare not my gouernment                                          2698
                                                                      2699
Iago. I once more take my leaue.                                      2700
Enter.                                                                2701
                                                                      2702
Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,                              2703
And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit                       2704
Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,                        2705
Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,                   2706
I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde                     2707
To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,                           2708
And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation                         2709
That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd                            2710
Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)                         2711
Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe                              2712
Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!                           2713
That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,                       2714
And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,                      2715
And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,                                2716
Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue                               2717
For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,                   2718
Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,                            2719
'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:                                 2720
Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,                         2721
When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:                            2722
Enter Desdemona and aemilia.                                          2723
                                                                      2724
If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:                              2725
Ile not beleeue't                                                     2726
                                                                      2727
Des. How now, my deere Othello?                                       2728
Your dinner, and the generous Islanders                               2729
By you inuited, do attend your presence                               2730
                                                                      2731
Oth. I am too blame                                                   2732
                                                                      2733
Des. Why do you speake so faintly?                                    2734
Are you not well?                                                     2735
Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere                           2736
                                                                      2737
Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.                    2738
Let me but binde it hard, within this houre                           2739
It will be well                                                       2740
                                                                      2741
Oth. Your Napkin is too little:                                       2742
Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.                               2743
Enter.                                                                2744
                                                                      2745
Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.                           2746
Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:                            2747
This was her first remembrance from the Moore,                        2748
My wayward Husband hath a hundred times                               2749
Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,                    2750
(For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)                       2751
That she reserues it euermore about her,                              2752
To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,                 2753
And giu't Iago: what he will do with it                               2754
Heauen knowes, not I:                                                 2755
I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.                                2756
Enter Iago.                                                           2757
                                                                      2758
Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?                               2759
Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you                       2760
                                                                      2761
Iago. You haue a thing for me?                                        2762
It is a common thing-                                                 2763
Aemil. Hah?                                                           2764
Iago. To haue a foolish wife.                                         2765
Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now                     2766
For that same Handkerchiefe                                           2767
                                                                      2768
Iago. What Handkerchiefe?                                             2769
Aemil. What Handkerchiefe?                                            2770
Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,                           2771
That which so often you did bid me steale                             2772
                                                                      2773
Iago. Hast stolne it from her?                                        2774
Aemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,                         2775
And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:                       2776
Looke, heere 'tis                                                     2777
                                                                      2778
Iago. A good wench, giue it me.                                       2779
Aemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene                    2780
so earnest to haue me filch it?                                       2781
Iago. Why, what is that to you?                                       2782
Aemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,                       2783
Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad                           2784
When she shall lacke it                                               2785
                                                                      2786
Iago. Be not acknowne on't:                                           2787
I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.                                      2788
                                                                      2789
Exit aemil.                                                           2790
                                                                      2791
I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,                         2792
And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,                          2793
Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,                            2794
As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.                       2795
The Moore already changes with my poyson:                             2796
Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,                    2797
Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:                      2798
But with a little acte vpon the blood,                                2799
Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.                       2800
Enter Othello.                                                        2801
                                                                      2802
Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,                      2803
Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world                              2804
Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe                        2805
Which thou owd'st yesterday                                           2806
                                                                      2807
Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?                                            2808
Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that                           2809
                                                                      2810
Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:                   2811
I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,                               2812
Then but to know't a little                                           2813
                                                                      2814
Iago. How now, my Lord?                                               2815
Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?                  2816
I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:                        2817
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.          2818
I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:                            2819
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,                        2820
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all                        2821
                                                                      2822
Iago. I am sorry to heare this?                                       2823
Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,                        2824
Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,                           2825
So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer                             2826
Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;                       2827
Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,                    2828
That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,                             2829
Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,                   2830
The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,                     2831
The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,                                  2832
Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:                     2833
And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates                        2834
Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,                       2835
Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone                                 2836
                                                                      2837
Iago. Is't possible my Lord?                                          2838
Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;                    2839
Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,                            2840
Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,                               2841
Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog                           2842
Then answer my wak'd wrath                                            2843
                                                                      2844
Iago. Is't come to this?                                              2845
Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,                 2846
That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,                        2847
To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life                              2848
                                                                      2849
Iago. My Noble Lord                                                   2850
                                                                      2851
Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,                        2852
Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse                                  2853
On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:                                  2854
Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;                      2855
For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,                             2856
Greater then that                                                     2857
                                                                      2858
Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!                                   2859
Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?                            2860
God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,                     2861
That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!                            2862
Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)                    2863
To be direct and honest, is not safe.                                 2864
I thanke you for this profit, and from hence                          2865
Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence                     2866
                                                                      2867
Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest                               2868
                                                                      2869
Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,                       2870
And looses that it workes for                                         2871
                                                                      2872
Oth. By the World,                                                    2873
I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:                    2874
I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:                 2875
Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh                       2876
As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke                           2877
As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,                      2878
Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,                             2879
Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied                             2880
                                                                      2881
Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:                            2882
I do repent me, that I put it to you.                                 2883
You would be satisfied?                                               2884
Oth. Would? Nay, and I will                                           2885
                                                                      2886
Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?                       2887
Would you the super-vision grossely gape on?                          2888
Behold her top'd?                                                     2889
Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!                                        2890
Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,                         2891
To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,                      2892
If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster                             2893
More then their owne. What then? How then?                            2894
What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?                               2895
It is impossible you should see this,                                 2896
Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,                     2897
As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse                      2898
As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,                            2899
If imputation, and strong circumstances,                              2900
Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,                           2901
Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't                          2902
                                                                      2903
Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall                          2904
                                                                      2905
Iago. I do not like the Office.                                       2906
But sith I am entred in this cause so farre                           2907
(Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)                          2908
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,                               2909
And being troubled with a raging tooth,                               2910
I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,                         2911
So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter                  2912
Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:                          2913
In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,                           2914
Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,                                2915
And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:                     2916
Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,                           2917
As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,                              2918
That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,                  2919
And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,                        2920
That gaue thee to the Moore                                           2921
                                                                      2922
Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!                                          2923
Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame                                    2924
                                                                      2925
Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,                         2926
'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame                       2927
                                                                      2928
Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,                    2929
That do demonstrate thinly                                            2930
                                                                      2931
Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces                                      2932
                                                                      2933
Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,                       2934
She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,                              2935
Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe                          2936
Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?                        2937
Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift                       2938
                                                                      2939
Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe                       2940
(I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day                            2941
See Cassio wipe his Beard with                                        2942
                                                                      2943
Oth. If it be that                                                    2944
                                                                      2945
Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.                             2946
It speakes against her with the other proofes                         2947
                                                                      2948
Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:                     2949
One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.                           2950
Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,                             2951
All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.                 2952
Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,                         2953
Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne                      2954
To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,                     2955
For 'tis of Aspickes tongues                                          2956
                                                                      2957
Iago. Yet be content                                                  2958
                                                                      2959
Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood                                           2960
                                                                      2961
Iago. Patience I say: your minde may change                           2962
                                                                      2963
Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,                            2964
Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,                            2965
Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on                         2966
To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:                               2967
Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace                         2968
Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,                   2969
Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge                                2970
Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,                           2971
In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,                                 2972
I heere engage my words                                               2973
                                                                      2974
Iago. Do not rise yet:                                                2975
Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue,                               2976
You Elements, that clip vs round about,                               2977
Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp                                 2978
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,                               2979
To wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command,                        2980
And to obey shall be in me remorse,                                   2981
What bloody businesse euer                                            2982
                                                                      2983
Oth. I greet thy loue,                                                2984
Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,                 2985
And will vpon the instant put thee too't.                             2986
Within these three dayes let me heare thee say,                       2987
That Cassio's not aliue                                               2988
                                                                      2989
Iago. My Friend is dead:                                              2990
'Tis done at your Request.                                            2991
But let her liue                                                      2992
                                                                      2993
Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:                                            2994
O damne her, damne her.                                               2995
Come go with me a-part, I will withdraw                               2996
To furnish me with some swift meanes of death                         2997
For the faire Diuell.                                                 2998
Now art thou my Lieutenant                                            2999
                                                                      3000
Iago. I am your owne for euer.                                        3001
                                                                      3002
Exeunt.                                                               3003
                                                                      3004
                                                                      3005
Scaena Quarta.                                                        3006
                                                                      3007
Enter Desdemona, aemilia, and Clown.                                  3008
                                                                      3009
Des. Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio                      3010
lyes?                                                                 3011
Clow. I dare not say he lies any where                                3012
                                                                      3013
Des. Why man?                                                         3014
Clo. He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes,               3015
'tis stabbing                                                         3016
                                                                      3017
Des. Go too: where lodges he?                                         3018
Clo. To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where                 3019
I lye                                                                 3020
                                                                      3021
Des. Can any thing be made of this?                                   3022
Clo. I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise                3023
a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were              3024
to lye in mine owne throat                                            3025
                                                                      3026
Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?               3027
Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make                3028
Questions, and by them answer                                         3029
                                                                      3030
Des. Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I                    3031
haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will                 3032
be well                                                               3033
                                                                      3034
Clo. To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit,                  3035
and therefore I will attempt the doing it.                            3036
                                                                      3037
Exit Clo.                                                             3038
                                                                      3039
Des. Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, aemilia?                 3040
Aemil. I know not Madam                                               3041
                                                                      3042
Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse                      3043
Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore                             3044
Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,                      3045
As iealious Creatures are, it were enough                             3046
To put him to ill-thinking.                                           3047
Aemil. Is he not iealious?                                            3048
Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,                    3049
Drew all such humors from him.                                        3050
Aemil. Looke where he comes.                                          3051
Enter Othello.                                                        3052
                                                                      3053
Des. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be                         3054
Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?                            3055
Oth. Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!                      3056
How do you, Desdemona?                                                3057
Des. Well, my good Lord                                               3058
                                                                      3059
Oth. Giue me your hand.                                               3060
This hand is moist, my Lady                                           3061
                                                                      3062
Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow                        3063
                                                                      3064
Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:                   3065
Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires                      3066
A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,                        3067
Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,                                    3068
For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere                         3069
That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,                               3070
A franke one                                                          3071
                                                                      3072
Des. You may (indeed) say so:                                         3073
For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart                           3074
                                                                      3075
Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:                  3076
But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts                             3077
                                                                      3078
Des. I cannot speake of this:                                         3079
Come, now your promise                                                3080
                                                                      3081
Oth. What promise, Chucke?                                            3082
Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you                   3083
                                                                      3084
Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:                       3085
Lend me thy Handkerchiefe                                             3086
                                                                      3087
Des. Heere my Lord                                                    3088
                                                                      3089
Oth. That which I gaue you                                            3090
                                                                      3091
Des. I haue it not about me                                           3092
                                                                      3093
Oth. Not?                                                             3094
Des. No indeed, my Lord                                               3095
                                                                      3096
Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe                               3097
Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue:                                   3098
She was a Charmer, and could almost read                              3099
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,              3100
'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father                       3101
Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,                             3102
Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye                                 3103
Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt                  3104
After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,                             3105
And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)                         3106
To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,                        3107
Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:                            3108
To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,                      3109
As nothing else could match                                           3110
                                                                      3111
Des. Is't possible?                                                   3112
Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:                     3113
A Sybill that had numbred in the world                                3114
The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,                             3115
In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:                            3116
The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,                  3117
And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull                         3118
Conseru'd of Maidens hearts                                           3119
                                                                      3120
Des. Indeed? Is't true?                                               3121
Oth. Most veritable, therefore looke too't well                       3122
                                                                      3123
Des. Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't?                  3124
Oth. Ha? wherefore?                                                   3125
Des. Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?                       3126
Oth. Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?                  3127
Des. Blesse vs                                                        3128
                                                                      3129
Oth. Say you?                                                         3130
Des. It is not lost: but what and if it were?                         3131
Oth. How?                                                             3132
Des. I say it is not lost                                             3133
                                                                      3134
Oth. Fetcht, let me see't                                             3135
                                                                      3136
Des. Why so I can: but I will not now:                                3137
This is a tricke to put me from my suite,                             3138
Pray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe                                3139
                                                                      3140
Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,                                      3141
My minde mis-giues                                                    3142
                                                                      3143
Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient                  3144
man                                                                   3145
                                                                      3146
Oth. The Handkerchiefe                                                3147
                                                                      3148
Des. A man that all his time                                          3149
Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;                          3150
Shar'd dangers with you                                               3151
                                                                      3152
Oth. The Handkerchiefe                                                3153
                                                                      3154
Des. Insooth, you are too blame                                       3155
                                                                      3156
Oth. Away.                                                            3157
                                                                      3158
Exit Othello.                                                         3159
                                                                      3160
Aemil. Is not this man iealious?                                      3161
Des. I neu'r saw this before.                                         3162
Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,                      3163
I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.                                 3164
Aemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:                       3165
They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,                      3166
They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full                         3167
They belch vs.                                                        3168
Enter Iago, and Cassio.                                               3169
                                                                      3170
Looke you, Cassio and my Husband                                      3171
                                                                      3172
Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:                     3173
And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her                         3174
                                                                      3175
Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with                      3176
you?                                                                  3177
Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,                     3178
That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe                            3179
Exist, and be a member of his loue,                                   3180
Whom I, with all the Office of my heart                               3181
Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.                               3182
If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,                              3183
That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,                       3184
Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,                                       3185
Can ransome me into his loue againe,                                  3186
But to know so, must be my benefit:                                   3187
So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,                             3188
And shut my selfe vp in some other course                             3189
To Fortunes Almes                                                     3190
                                                                      3191
Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)                                      3192
My Aduocation is not now in Tune;                                     3193
My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,                       3194
Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.                              3195
So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,                                  3196
As I haue spoken for you all my best,                                 3197
And stood within the blanke of his displeasure                        3198
For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:                       3199
What I can do, I will: and more I will                                3200
Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you                       3201
                                                                      3202
Iago. Is my Lord angry?                                               3203
Aemil. He went hence but now:                                         3204
And certainly in strange vnquietnesse                                 3205
                                                                      3206
Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon                         3207
When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,                         3208
And like the Diuell from his very Arme                                3209
Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?                             3210
Something of moment then: I will go meet him,                         3211
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.                           3212
                                                                      3213
Exit                                                                  3214
                                                                      3215
Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,                        3216
Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise                        3217
Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,                            3218
Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,                     3219
Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,                           3220
Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.                     3221
For let our finger ake, and it endues                                 3222
Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense                         3223
Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,                       3224
Nor of them looke for such obseruancie                                3225
As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,                        3226
I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)                                   3227
Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:                             3228
But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,                         3229
And he's Indited falsely.                                             3230
Aemil. Pray heauen it bee                                             3231
State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,                      3232
Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you                                   3233
                                                                      3234
Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.                            3235
Aemil. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;                   3236
They are not euer iealious for the cause,                             3237
But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster                   3238
Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe                                3239
                                                                      3240
Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.                    3241
Aemil. Lady, Amen                                                     3242
                                                                      3243
Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:                  3244
If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,                          3245
And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.                               3246
                                                                      3247
Exit                                                                  3248
                                                                      3249
Cas. I humbly thanke your Ladyship.                                   3250
Enter Bianca.                                                         3251
                                                                      3252
Bian. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.)                                      3253
Cassio. What make you from home?                                      3254
How is't with you, my most faire Bianca?                              3255
Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house                       3256
                                                                      3257
Bian. And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio.                        3258
What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?                    3259
Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres                    3260
More tedious then the Diall, eight score times?                       3261
Oh weary reck'ning                                                    3262
                                                                      3263
Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca:                                            3264
I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,                   3265
But I shall in a more continuate time                                 3266
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca                        3267
Take me this worke out                                                3268
                                                                      3269
Bianca. Oh Cassio, whence came this?                                  3270
This is some Token from a newer Friend,                               3271
To the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause:                             3272
Is't come to this? Well, well                                         3273
                                                                      3274
Cassio. Go too, woman:                                                3275
Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,                          3276
From whence you haue them. You are iealious now,                      3277
That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;                     3278
No, in good troth Bianca                                              3279
                                                                      3280
Bian. Why, who's is it?                                               3281
Cassio. I know not neither:                                           3282
I found it in my Chamber,                                             3283
I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded                             3284
(As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:                     3285
Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time                        3286
                                                                      3287
Bian. Leaue you? Wherefore?                                           3288
Cassio. I do attend heere on the Generall,                            3289
And thinke it no addition, nor my wish                                3290
To haue him see me woman'd                                            3291
                                                                      3292
Bian. Why, I pray you?                                                3293
Cassio. Not that I loue you not                                       3294
                                                                      3295
Bian. But that you do not loue me.                                    3296
I pray you bring me on the way a little,                              3297
And say, if I shall see you soone at night?                           3298
Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,                   3299
For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone                             3300
                                                                      3301
Bian. 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.                        3302
                                                                      3303
Exeunt. omnes.                                                        3304
                                                                      3305
                                                                      3306
Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.                                           3307
                                                                      3308
Enter Othello, and Iago.                                              3309
                                                                      3310
Iago. Will you thinke so?                                             3311
Oth. Thinke so, Iago?                                                 3312
Iago. What, to kisse in priuate?                                      3313
Oth. An vnauthoriz'd kisse?                                           3314
Iago. Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,                          3315
An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?                             3316
Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?                         3317
It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:                                  3318
They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,                            3319
The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen                 3320
                                                                      3321
Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:                        3322
But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe                                 3323
                                                                      3324
Oth. What then?                                                       3325
Iago. Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,                    3326
She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man                                3327
                                                                      3328
Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:                            3329
May she giue that?                                                    3330
Iago. Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,                       3331
They haue it very oft, that haue it not.                              3332
But for the Handkerchiefe                                             3333
                                                                      3334
Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:                  3335
Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,                             3336
As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:                          3337
Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe                               3338
                                                                      3339
Iago . I: what of that?                                               3340
Othe. That's not so good now                                          3341
                                                                      3342
Iag. What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?                3343
Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,                           3344
Who hauing by their owne importunate suit,                            3345
Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris,                                  3346
Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse                              3347
But they must blab.)                                                  3348
Oth. Hath he said any thing?                                          3349
Iago. He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,                      3350
No more then he'le vn-sweare                                          3351
                                                                      3352
Oth. What hath he said?                                               3353
Iago. Why, that he did: I know not what he did                        3354
                                                                      3355
Othe. What? What?                                                     3356
Iago. Lye                                                             3357
                                                                      3358
Oth. With her?                                                        3359
Iago. With her? On her: what you will                                 3360
                                                                      3361
Othe. Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,                    3362
when they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:                  3363
Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse,               3364
and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,                    3365
and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not               3366
inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some              3367
Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)              3368
Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe?     3369
O diuell.                                                             3370
                                                                      3371
Falls in a Traunce.                                                   3372
                                                                      3373
Iago. Worke on,                                                       3374
My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,                 3375
And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,                           3376
(All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?                   3377
My Lord, I say: Othello.                                              3378
Enter Cassio.                                                         3379
                                                                      3380
How now Cassio?                                                       3381
Cas. What's the matter?                                               3382
Iago. My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,                             3383
This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday                          3384
                                                                      3385
Cas. Rub him about the Temples                                        3386
                                                                      3387
Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:                       3388
If not, he foames at mouth: and by and by                             3389
Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:                    3390
Do you withdraw your selfe a little while,                            3391
He will recouer straight: when he is gone,                            3392
I would on great occasion, speake with you.                           3393
How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?                      3394
Othe. Dost thou mocke me?                                             3395
Iago. I mocke you not, by Heauen:                                     3396
Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man                         3397
                                                                      3398
Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast                           3399
                                                                      3400
Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,                   3401
And many a ciuill Monster                                             3402
                                                                      3403
Othe. Did he confesse it?                                             3404
Iago. Good Sir, be a man:                                             3405
Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd                         3406
May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,                        3407
That nightly lye in those vnproper beds,                              3408
Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.                 3409
Oh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock,                    3410
To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;                                    3411
And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,                            3412
And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe                        3413
                                                                      3414
Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine                                 3415
                                                                      3416
Iago. Stand you a while apart,                                        3417
Confine your selfe but in a patient List,                             3418
Whil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe                 3419
(A passion most resulting such a man)                                 3420
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,                               3421
And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,                               3422
Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,                       3423
The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,                      3424
And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes                 3425
That dwell in euery Region of his face.                               3426
For I will make him tell the Tale anew;                               3427
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when                           3428
He hath, and is againe to cope your wife.                             3429
I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,                         3430
Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,                           3431
And nothing of a man                                                  3432
                                                                      3433
Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,                                         3434
I will be found most cunning in my Patience:                          3435
But (do'st thou heare) most bloody                                    3436
                                                                      3437
Iago. That's not amisse,                                              3438
But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?                         3439
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,                                 3440
A Huswife that by selling her desires                                 3441
Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature                   3442
That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague                   3443
To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)                            3444
He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine                           3445
From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.                         3446
Enter Cassio.                                                         3447
                                                                      3448
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:                              3449
And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue                              3450
Poore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours                 3451
Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?                            3452
Cas. The worser, that you giue me the addition,                       3453
Whose want euen killes me                                             3454
                                                                      3455
Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't:                      3456
Now, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre,                              3457
How quickely should you speed?                                        3458
Cas. Alas poore Caitiffe                                              3459
                                                                      3460
Oth. Looke how he laughes already                                     3461
                                                                      3462
Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so                                  3463
                                                                      3464
Cas. Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me                   3465
                                                                      3466
Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out                     3467
                                                                      3468
Iago. Do you heare Cassio?                                            3469
Oth. Now he importunes him                                            3470
To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said                         3471
                                                                      3472
Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.                     3473
Do you intend it?                                                     3474
Cas. Ha, ha, ha                                                       3475
                                                                      3476
Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?                          3477
Cas. I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare                         3478
Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it                             3479
So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha                                            3480
                                                                      3481
Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes                          3482
                                                                      3483
Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her                            3484
                                                                      3485
Cas. Prythee say true                                                 3486
                                                                      3487
Iago. I am a very Villaine else                                       3488
                                                                      3489
Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well                                        3490
                                                                      3491
Cas. This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:                             3492
She is perswaded I will marry her                                     3493
Out of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise                3494
                                                                      3495
Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story                         3496
                                                                      3497
Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery                3498
place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke                    3499
with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the                        3500
Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck                               3501
                                                                      3502
Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports          3503
it                                                                    3504
                                                                      3505
Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:                      3506
So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha                                   3507
                                                                      3508
Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:                   3509
oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I                   3510
shall throw it to                                                     3511
                                                                      3512
Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie                               3513
                                                                      3514
Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.                               3515
Enter Bianca.                                                         3516
                                                                      3517
Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?                 3518
What do you meane by this haunting of me?                             3519
Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what                     3520
did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue                    3521
me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take               3522
out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should               3523
finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.             3524
This is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke?               3525
There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had                 3526
it, Ile take out no worke on't                                        3527
                                                                      3528
Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?                                    3529
How now? How now?                                                     3530
Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe                      3531
                                                                      3532
Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if                   3533
you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.                     3534
                                                                      3535
Exit                                                                  3536
                                                                      3537
Iago. After her: after her                                            3538
                                                                      3539
Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else                         3540
                                                                      3541
Iago. Will you sup there?                                             3542
Cassio. Yes, I intend so                                              3543
                                                                      3544
Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very                 3545
faine speake with you                                                 3546
                                                                      3547
Cas. Prythee come: will you?                                          3548
Iago. Go too; say no more                                             3549
                                                                      3550
Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago                                    3551
                                                                      3552
Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?                    3553
Oth. Oh, Iago                                                         3554
                                                                      3555
Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?                              3556
Oth. Was that mine?                                                   3557
Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes                    3558
the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he                  3559
hath giu'n it his whore                                               3560
                                                                      3561
Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:                          3562
A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?                          3563
Iago. Nay, you must forget that                                       3564
                                                                      3565
Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to                  3566
night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to              3567
stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world               3568
hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours            3569
side, and command him Taskes                                          3570
                                                                      3571
Iago. Nay, that's not your way                                        3572
                                                                      3573
Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate                 3574
with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will                   3575
sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous         3576
wit, and inuention?                                                   3577
Iago. She's the worse for all this                                    3578
                                                                      3579
Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:                               3580
And then of so gentle a condition?                                    3581
Iago. I too gentle                                                    3582
                                                                      3583
Othe. Nay that's certaine:                                            3584
But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it               3585
Iago                                                                  3586
                                                                      3587
Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her                 3588
pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere            3589
no body                                                               3590
                                                                      3591
Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?                         3592
Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her                                           3593
                                                                      3594
Oth. With mine Officer?                                               3595
Iago. That's fouler                                                   3596
                                                                      3597
Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not                   3598
expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide            3599
my mind againe: this night Iago                                       3600
                                                                      3601
Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,                 3602
Euen the bed she hath contaminated                                    3603
                                                                      3604
Oth. Good, good:                                                      3605
The Iustice of it pleases: very good                                  3606
                                                                      3607
Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker:                       3608
You shall heare more by midnight.                                     3609
Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.                            3610
                                                                      3611
Othe. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?                      3612
Iago. I warrant something from Venice,                                3613
'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.                             3614
See, your wife's with him                                             3615

Lodo. Saue you worthy Generall                                        3617
                                                                      3618
Othe. With all my heart Sir                                           3619
                                                                      3620
Lod. The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you                   3621
                                                                      3622
Othe. I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures                       3623
                                                                      3624
Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico                        3625
Iago. I am very glad to see you Signior:                              3626
Welcome to Cyprus                                                     3627
                                                                      3628
Lod. I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio?                        3629
Iago. Liues Sir,                                                      3630
Des. Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord,                    3631
An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well                         3632
                                                                      3633
Othe. Are you sure of that?                                           3634
Des. My Lord?                                                         3635
Othe. This faile you not to do, as you will-                          3636
Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,                        3637
Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?                         3638
Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much                              3639
T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio                       3640
                                                                      3641
Oth. Fire, and brimestone                                             3642
                                                                      3643
Des. My Lord                                                          3644

Oth. Are you wise?                                                    3646
Des. What is he angrie?                                               3647
Lod. May be the Letter mou'd him.                                     3648
For as I thinke, they do command him home,                            3649
Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment                                     3650
                                                                      3651
Des. Trust me, I am glad on't                                         3652
                                                                      3653
Othe. Indeed?                                                         3654
Des. My Lord?                                                         3655
Othe. I am glad to see you mad                                        3656
                                                                      3657
Des. Why, sweete Othello?                                             3658
Othe. Diuell                                                          3659

Des. I haue not deseru'd this                                         3661
                                                                      3662
Lod. My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice,                   3663
Though I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much,                       3664
Make her amends: she weepes                                           3665
                                                                      3666
Othe. Oh diuell, diuell:                                              3667
If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares,                     3668
Each drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile:                         3669
Out of my sight                                                       3670
                                                                      3671
Des. I will not stay to offend you                                    3672
                                                                      3673
Lod. Truely obedient Lady:                                            3674
I do beseech your Lordship call her backe                             3675
                                                                      3676
Othe. Mistris                                                         3677

Des. My Lord                                                          3679
                                                                      3680
Othe. What would you with her, Sir?                                   3681
Lod. Who I, my Lord?                                                  3682
Othe. I, you did wish, that I would make her turne:                   3683
Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on                          3684
And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.                      3685
And she's obedient: as you say obedient.                              3686
Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.                            3687
Concerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion)                        3688
I am commanded home: get you away:                                    3689
Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,                        3690
And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:                            3691
Cassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night                         3692
I do entreat, that we may sup together.                               3693
You are welcome Sir to Cyprus.                                        3694
Goates, and Monkeys.                                                  3695
Enter.                                                                3696
                                                                      3697
Lod. Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate                    3698
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature                        3699
Whom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue                      3700
The shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance                              3701
Could neither graze, nor pierce?                                      3702
Iago. He is much chang'd                                              3703
                                                                      3704
Lod. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine?                    3705
Iago. He's that he is: I may not breath my censure.                   3706
What he might be: if what he might, he is not,                        3707
I would to heauen he were                                             3708
                                                                      3709
Lod. What? Strike his wife?                                           3710
Iago. 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew                   3711
That stroke would proue the worst                                     3712
                                                                      3713
Lod. Is it his vse?                                                   3714
Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,                             3715
And new create his fault?                                             3716
Iago. Alas, alas:                                                     3717
It is not honestie in me to speake                                    3718
What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,                 3719
And his owne courses will denote him so,                              3720
That I may saue my speech: do but go after                            3721
And marke how he continues                                            3722
                                                                      3723
Lod. I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him.                            3724
                                                                      3725
Exeunt.                                                               3726
                                                                      3727
                                                                      3728
Scena Secunda.                                                        3729
                                                                      3730
Enter Othello and aemilia.                                            3731
                                                                      3732
Othe. You haue seene nothing then?                                    3733
Aemil. Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect                           3734
                                                                      3735
Othe. Yes, you haue seene Cassio, and she together                    3736
                                                                      3737
Aemi. But then I saw no harme: and then I heard,                      3738
Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them                       3739
                                                                      3740
Othe. What? Did they neuer whisper?                                   3741
Aemil. Neuer my Lord                                                  3742
                                                                      3743
Othe. Nor send you out o'th' way?                                     3744
Aemil. Neuer                                                          3745
                                                                      3746
Othe. To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor nothing?            3747
Aemil. Neuer my Lord                                                  3748
                                                                      3749
Othe. That's strange.                                                 3750
Aemil. I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest:                     3751
Lay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other,                     3752
Remoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome:                       3753
If any wretch haue put this in your head,                             3754
Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse,                         3755
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,                           3756
There's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues                       3757
Is foule as Slander                                                   3758
                                                                      3759
Othe. Bid her come hither: go.                                        3760
                                                                      3761
Exit aemilia.                                                         3762
                                                                      3763
She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud                             3764
That cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore:                     3765
A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets,                         3766
And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.               3767
Enter Desdemona, and aemilia.                                         3768
                                                                      3769
Des. My Lord, what is your will?                                      3770
Othe. Pray you Chucke come hither                                     3771
                                                                      3772
Des. What is your pleasure?                                           3773
Oth. Let me see your eyes: looke in my face                           3774
                                                                      3775
Des. What horrible Fancie's this?                                     3776
Othe. Some of your Function Mistris:                                  3777
Leaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore:                           3778
Cough, or cry hem; if any body come:                                  3779
Your Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch.                             3780
                                                                      3781
Exit aemi.                                                            3782
                                                                      3783
Des. Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import?                      3784
I vnderstand a Fury in your words                                     3785
                                                                      3786
Othe. Why? What art thou?                                             3787
Des. Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife                     3788
                                                                      3789
Othello. Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least                       3790
being like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should               3791
feare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare               3792
thou art honest                                                       3793
                                                                      3794
Des. Heauen doth truely know it                                       3795
                                                                      3796
Othe. Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell               3797
                                                                      3798
Des. To whom my Lord?                                                 3799
With whom? How am I false?                                            3800
Othe. Ah Desdemon, away, away, away                                   3801
                                                                      3802
Des. Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?                            3803
Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord?                              3804
If happely you my Father do suspect,                                  3805
An Instrument of this your calling backe,                             3806
Lay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him,                       3807
I haue lost him too                                                   3808
                                                                      3809
Othe. Had it pleas'd Heauen,                                          3810
To try me with Affliction, had they rain'd                            3811
All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:                        3812
Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.                            3813
Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,                         3814
I should haue found in some place of my Soule                         3815
A drop of patience. But alas, to make me                              3816
The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,                              3817
To point his slow, and mouing finger at.                              3818
Yet could I beare that too, well, very well:                          3819
But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart,                           3820
Where either I must liue, or beare no life,                           3821
The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes,                       3822
Or else dries vp: to be discarded thence,                             3823
Or keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades                           3824
To knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there:                    3825
Patience, thou young and Rose-lip'd Cherubin,                         3826
I heere looke grim as hell                                            3827
                                                                      3828
Des. I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest                          3829
                                                                      3830
Othe. Oh I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles,                      3831
That quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed:                         3832
Who art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete,                      3833
That the Sense akes at thee,                                          3834
Would thou had'st neuer bin borne                                     3835
                                                                      3836
Des. Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?                        3837
Othe. Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke                    3838
Made to write Whore vpon? What commited,                              3839
Committed? Oh, thou publicke Commoner,                                3840
I should make very Forges of my cheekes,                              3841
That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,                              3842
Did I but speake thy deedes. What commited?                           3843
Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:                   3844
The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes,                            3845
Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth                             3846
And will not hear't. What commited?                                   3847
Des. By Heauen you do me wrong                                        3848
                                                                      3849
Othe. Are not you a Strumpet?                                         3850
Des. No, as I am a Christian.                                         3851
If to preserue this vessell for my Lord,                              3852
From any other foule vnlawfull touch                                  3853
Be not to be a Strumpet, I am none                                    3854
                                                                      3855
Othe. What, not a Whore?                                              3856
Des. No, as I shall be sau'd                                          3857
                                                                      3858
Othe. Is't possible?                                                  3859
Des. Oh Heauen forgiue vs                                             3860
                                                                      3861
Othe. I cry you mercy then.                                           3862
I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,                         3863
That married with Othello. You Mistris,                               3864
Enter aemilia.                                                        3865
                                                                      3866
That haue the office opposite to Saint Peter,                         3867
And keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you.                         3868
We haue done our course: there's money for your paines:               3869
I pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile.                    3870
Enter.                                                                3871
                                                                      3872
Aemil. Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue?                       3873
How do you Madam? how do you my good Lady?                            3874
Des. Faith, halfe a sleepe                                            3875
                                                                      3876
Aemi. Good Madam,                                                     3877
What's the matter with my Lord?                                       3878
Des. With who?                                                        3879
Aemil. Why, with my Lord, Madam?                                      3880
Des. Who is thy Lord?                                                 3881
Aemil. He that is yours, sweet Lady                                   3882
                                                                      3883
Des. I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia,                        3884
I cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none,                             3885
But what should go by water. Prythee to night,                        3886
Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember,                           3887
And call thy husband hither.                                          3888
Aemil. Heere's a change indeed.                                       3889
Enter.                                                                3890
                                                                      3891
Des. 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete.                      3892
How haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke                          3893
The small'st opinion on my least misvse?                              3894
Enter Iago, and aemilia.                                              3895
                                                                      3896
Iago. What is your pleasure Madam?                                    3897
How is't with you?                                                    3898
Des. I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes                    3899
Do it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes.                           3900
He might haue chid me so; for in good faith                           3901
I am a Child to chiding                                               3902
                                                                      3903
Iago. What is the matter Lady?                                        3904
Aemil. Alas (Iago) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her,                      3905
Throwne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her                      3906
That true hearts cannot beare it                                      3907
                                                                      3908
Des. Am I that name, Iago?                                            3909
Iago. What name, (faire Lady?)                                        3910
Des. Such as she said my Lord did say I was.                          3911
Aemil. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:                   3912
Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet                       3913
                                                                      3914
Iago. Why did he so?                                                  3915
Des. I do not know: I am sure I am none such                          3916
                                                                      3917
Iago. Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day.                       3918
Aemil. Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches?                       3919
Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends?                         3920
To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?                      3921
Des. It is my wretched Fortune                                        3922
                                                                      3923
Iago. Beshrew him for't:                                              3924
How comes this Tricke vpon him?                                       3925
Des. Nay, Heauen doth know                                            3926
                                                                      3927
Aemi. I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine,                    3928
Some busie and insinuating Rogue,                                     3929
Some cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office,                     3930
Haue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else                  3931
                                                                      3932
Iago. Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible                     3933
                                                                      3934
Des. If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.                         3935
Aemil. A halter pardon him:                                           3936
And hell gnaw his bones.                                              3937
Why should he call her Whore?                                         3938
Who keepes her companie?                                              3939
What Place? What Time?                                                3940
What Forme? What liklyhood?                                           3941
The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,                      3942
Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.                        3943
Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,                    3944
And put in euery honest hand a whip                                   3945
To lash the Rascalls naked through the world,                         3946
Euen from the East to th' West                                        3947
                                                                      3948
Iago. Speake within doore.                                            3949
Aemil. Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was                      3950
That turn'd your wit, the seamy-side without,                         3951
And made you to suspect me with the Moore                             3952
                                                                      3953
Iago. You are a Foole: go too                                         3954
                                                                      3955
Des. Alas Iago,                                                       3956
What shall I do to win my Lord againe?                                3957
Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,                  3958
I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:                            3959
If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,                        3960
Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,                      3961
Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence                           3962
Delighted them: or any other Forme.                                   3963
Or that I do not yet, and euer did,                                   3964
And euer will, (though he do shake me off                             3965
To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,                            3966
Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,                        3967
And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,                               3968
But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,                          3969
It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,                             3970
To do the Act, that might the addition earne,                         3971
Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me                         3972
                                                                      3973
Iago. I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:                     3974
The businesse of the State do's him offence                           3975
                                                                      3976
Des. If 'twere no other                                               3977
                                                                      3978
Iago. It is but so, I warrant,                                        3979
Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper:                        3980
The Messengers of Venice staies the meate,                            3981
Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.                       3982
                                                                      3983
Exeunt. Desdemona and aemilia.                                        3984
                                                                      3985
Enter Rodorigo.                                                       3986
                                                                      3987
How now Rodorigo?                                                     3988
Rod. I do not finde                                                   3989
That thou deal'st iustly with me                                      3990
                                                                      3991
Iago. What in the contrarie?                                          3992
Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise                      3993
Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from                3994
me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage       3995
of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor                       3996
am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I                 3997
haue foolishly suffred                                                3998
                                                                      3999
Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?                                     4000
Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and                     4001
Performances are no kin together                                      4002
                                                                      4003
Iago. You charge me most vniustly                                     4004
                                                                      4005
Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my                         4006
selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from                  4007
me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a                 4008
Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,                    4009
and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine                  4010
respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none                           4011
                                                                      4012
Iago. Well, go too: very well                                         4013
                                                                      4014
Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor                    4015
'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to            4016
finde my selfe fopt in it                                             4017
                                                                      4018
Iago. Very well                                                       4019
                                                                      4020
Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my                 4021
selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my                  4022
Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull             4023
solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke                 4024
satisfaction of you                                                   4025
                                                                      4026
Iago. You haue said now                                               4027
                                                                      4028
Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment               4029
of doing                                                              4030
                                                                      4031
Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and                      4032
euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion              4033
then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.                          4034
Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception:                     4035
but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy                   4036
Affaire                                                               4037
                                                                      4038
Rod. It hath not appeer'd                                             4039
                                                                      4040
Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and                        4041
your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.                      4042
But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which                 4043
I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I                     4044
meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night                        4045
shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not                   4046
Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,                   4047
and deuise Engines for my life                                        4048
                                                                      4049
Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?             4050
Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from                    4051
Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place                            4052
                                                                      4053
Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona                     4054
returne againe to Venice                                              4055
                                                                      4056
Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh                       4057
away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode                  4058
be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein                            4059
none can be so determinate, as the remouing of                        4060
Cassio                                                                4061
                                                                      4062
Rod. How do you meane remouing him?                                   4063
Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's                       4064
place: knocking out his braines                                       4065
                                                                      4066
Rod. And that you would haue me to do                                 4067
                                                                      4068
Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a                    4069
right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither                  4070
will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable                 4071
Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which                    4072
I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)                   4073
you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere                    4074
to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene                    4075
vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with                   4076
me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that              4077
you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It                4078
is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.                4079
About it                                                              4080
                                                                      4081
Rod. I will heare further reason for this                             4082
                                                                      4083
Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.                                       4084
                                                                      4085
Exeunt.                                                               4086
                                                                      4087
                                                                      4088
Scena Tertia.                                                         4089
                                                                      4090
Enter Othello, Lodouico, Desdemona, aemilia, and Atendants.           4091
                                                                      4092
Lod. I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further              4093
                                                                      4094
Oth. Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke                         4095
                                                                      4096

                                                                      4099

Oth. Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona                                 4102
                                                                      4103
Des. My Lord                                                          4104

                                                                      4110

Giue me my nightly wearing, and adieu.                                4121
We must not now displease him.                                        4122
Aemil. I, would you had neuer seene him                               4123
                                                                      4124
Des. So would not I: my loue doth so approue him,                     4125
That euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes,                  4126
(Prythee vn-pin me) haue grace and fauour                             4127
                                                                      4128
Aemi. I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed                 4129
                                                                      4130
Des. All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?               4131
If I do die before, prythee shrow'd me                                4132
In one of these same Sheetes.                                         4133
Aemil. Come, come: you talke                                          4134
                                                                      4135
Des. My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie,                            4136
She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,                         4137
And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,                      4138
An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,                     4139
And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,                          4140
Will not go from my mind: I haue much to do,                          4141
But to go hang my head all at one side                                4142
And sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch                     4143
                                                                      4144
Aemi. Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne?                              4145
Des. No, vn-pin me here,                                              4146
This Lodouico is a proper man.                                        4147
Aemil. A very handsome man                                            4148
                                                                      4149
Des. He speakes well.                                                 4150
Aemil. I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd                      4151
barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip                   4152
                                                                      4153
Des. The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree.                 4154
Sing all a greene Willough:                                           4155
Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee,                          4156
Sing Willough, Willough, Willough.                                    4157
The fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes                4158
Sing Willough, &c.                                                    4159
Her salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones,                4160
Sing Willough, &c. (Lay by these)                                     4161
Willough, Willough. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon)              4162
Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland.                        4163
Let no body blame him, his scorne I approue.                          4164
(Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks?                    4165
Aemil. It's the wind                                                  4166
                                                                      4167
Des. I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then?              4168
Sing Willough, &c.                                                    4169
If I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men.                        4170
So get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch:                      4171
Doth that boade weeping?                                              4172
Aemil. 'Tis neyther heere, nor there                                  4173
                                                                      4174
Des. I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!                 4175
Do'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me aemilia)                     4176
That there be women do abuse their husbands                           4177
In such grosse kinde?                                                 4178
Aemil. There be some such, no question                                4179
                                                                      4180
Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world?                  4181
Aemil. Why, would not you?                                            4182
Des. No, by this Heauenly light.                                      4183
Aemil. Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light:                         4184
I might doo't as well i'th' darke                                     4185
                                                                      4186
Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?                   4187
Aemil. The world's a huge thing:                                      4188
It is a great price, for a small vice                                 4189
                                                                      4190
Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.                             4191
Aemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when                    4192
I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a                 4193
ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,                4194
Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for               4195
all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband              4196
a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture                    4197
Purgatory for't                                                       4198
                                                                      4199
Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong                           4200
For the whole world.                                                  4201
Aemil. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;                     4202
and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in                 4203
your owne world, and you might quickly make it right                  4204
                                                                      4205
Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.                         4206
Aemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as                   4207
would store the world they plaid for.                                 4208
But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults                           4209
If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,                4210
And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;                          4211
Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,                             4212
Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,                    4213
Or scant our former hauing in despight)                               4214
Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,                    4215
Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,                          4216
Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,                4217
And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,                      4218
As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,                            4219
When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?                          4220
I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?                          4221
I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?                       4222
It is so too. And haue not we Affections?                             4223
Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?                          4224
Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,                        4225
The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so                           4226
                                                                      4227
Des. Good night, good night:                                          4228
Heauen me such vses send,                                             4229
Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.                         4230
                                                                      4231
Exeunt.                                                               4232
                                                                      4233
Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.                                           4234
                                                                      4235
Enter Iago, and Rodorigo.                                             4236
                                                                      4237
Iago. Heere, stand behinde this Barke,                                4238
Straight will he come:                                                4239
Weare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home:                          4240
Quicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow,                   4241
It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,                         4242
And fixe most firme thy Resolution                                    4243
                                                                      4244
Rod. Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't                            4245
                                                                      4246
Iago. Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand                   4247
                                                                      4248
Rod. I haue no great deuotion to the deed,                            4249
And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:                          4250
'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies                          4251
                                                                      4252
Iago. I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense,                4253
And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,                     4254
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,                             4255
Euery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo,                              4256
He calles me to a restitution large                                   4257
Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,                           4258
As Guifts to Desdemona.                                               4259
It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,                                 4260
He hath a dayly beauty in his life,                                   4261
That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore                            4262
May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:                   4263
No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.                         4264
Enter Cassio.                                                         4265
                                                                      4266
Rod. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest                    4267
                                                                      4268
Cas. That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,                         4269
But that my Coate is better then thou know'st:                        4270
I will make proofe of thine                                           4271
                                                                      4272
Rod. Oh, I am slaine                                                  4273

Some good man beare him carefully from hence,                         4409
Ile fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris,                    4410
Saue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere (Cassio)              4411
Was my deere friend. What malice was between you                      4412
                                                                      4413
Cas. None in the world: nor do I know the man?                        4414
Iago. What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre.                  4415
Stay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris?                     4416
Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye?                             4417
Nay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon.                          4418
Behold her well: I pray you looke vpon her:                           4419
Do you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake                    4420
Though tongues were out of vse.                                       4421
Aemil. Alas, what is the matter?                                      4422
What is the matter, Husband?                                          4423
Iago. Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke                       4424
By Rodorigo, and Fellowes that are scap'd:                            4425
He's almost slaine, and Rodorigo quite dead.                          4426
Aemil. Alas good Gentleman: alas good Cassio                          4427
                                                                      4428
Iago. This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe aemilia,                  4429
Go know of Cassio where he supt to night.                             4430
What, do you shake at that?                                           4431
Bian. He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not                  4432
                                                                      4433
Iago. O did he so? I charge you go with me.                           4434
Aemil. Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet                                      4435
                                                                      4436
Bian. I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest,                        4437
As you that thus abuse me.                                            4438
Aemil. As I? Fie vpon thee                                            4439
                                                                      4440
Iago. Kinde Gentlemen:                                                4441
Let's go see poore Cassio drest.                                      4442
Come Mistris, you must tel's another Tale.                            4443
aemilia, run you to the Cittadell,                                    4444
And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:                          4445
Will you go on afore? This is the night                               4446
That either makes me, or foredoes me quight.                          4447
                                                                      4448
Exeunt.                                                               4449
                                                                      4450
Scoena Secunda.                                                       4451
                                                                      4452
Enter Othello, and Desdemona in her bed.                              4453
                                                                      4454
Oth. It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule)                      4455
Let me not name it to you, you chaste Starres,                        4456
It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,                          4457
Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow,                       4458
And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:                                 4459
Yet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men:                        4460
Put out the Light, and then put out the Light:                        4461
If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,                              4462
I can againe thy former light restore,                                4463
Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light,                       4464
Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature,                         4465
I know not where is that Promethaean heate                            4466
That can thy Light re-Lume.                                           4467
When I haue pluck'd thy Rose,                                         4468
I cannot giue it vitall growth againe,                                4469
It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.                     4470
Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade                            4471
Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:                      4472
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,                     4473
And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.                   4474
So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,                          4475
But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,                   4476
It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes                             4477
                                                                      4478
Des. Who's there? Othello?                                            4479
Othel. I Desdemona                                                    4480
                                                                      4481
Des. Will you come to bed, my Lord?                                   4482
Oth. Haue you pray'd to night, Desdemon?                              4483
Des. I my Lord                                                        4484
                                                                      4485
Oth. If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime                          4486
Vnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace,                             4487
Solicite for it straight                                              4488
                                                                      4489
Des. Alacke, my Lord,                                                 4490
What may you meane by that?                                           4491
Oth. Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by:                     4492
I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,                               4493
No, Heauens fore-fend) I would not kill thy Soule                     4494
                                                                      4495
Des. Talke you of killing?                                            4496
Oth. I, I do                                                          4497
                                                                      4498
Des. Then Heauen haue mercy on mee                                    4499
                                                                      4500
Oth. Amen, with all my heart                                          4501
                                                                      4502
Des. If you say, I hope you will not kill me                          4503
                                                                      4504
Oth. Humh                                                             4505
                                                                      4506
Des. And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then                      4507
When your eyes rowle so.                                              4508
Why I should feare, I know not,                                       4509
Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare                 4510
                                                                      4511
Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes                                             4512
                                                                      4513
Des. They are Loues I beare to you                                    4514
                                                                      4515
Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st                                       4516
                                                                      4517
Des. That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.                   4518
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?                                4519
Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame:                           4520
These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,                           4521
They do not point on me                                               4522
                                                                      4523
Oth. Peace, and be still                                              4524
                                                                      4525
Des. I will so: What's the matter?                                    4526
Oth. That Handkerchiefe                                               4527
Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio                4528
                                                                      4529
Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,                      4530
And aske him                                                          4531
                                                                      4532
Oth. Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,                    4533
Thou art on thy death-bed                                             4534
                                                                      4535
Des. I, but not yet to dye                                            4536
                                                                      4537
Oth. Presently.                                                       4538
Therefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne:                          4539
For to deny each Article with Oath,                                   4540
Cannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception                       4541
That I do grone withall. Thou art to dye                              4542
                                                                      4543
Des. O Heauen haue mercy on me                                        4544
                                                                      4545
Oth. I say, Amen                                                      4546
                                                                      4547
Des. And haue you mercy too. I neuer did                              4548
Offend you in my life: neuer lou'd Cassio,                            4549
But with such generall warrantie of Heauen,                           4550
As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token                               4551
                                                                      4552
Oth. By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.                      4553
O periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart,                          4554
And makes me call, what I intend to do,                               4555
A Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice.                               4556
I saw the Handkerchiefe                                               4557
                                                                      4558
Des. He found it then:                                                4559
I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:                            4560
Let him confesse a truth                                              4561
                                                                      4562
Oth. He hath confest                                                  4563
                                                                      4564
Des. What, my Lord?                                                   4565
Oth. That he hath vs'd thee                                           4566
                                                                      4567
Des. How? vnlawfully?                                                 4568
Oth. I                                                                4569
                                                                      4570
Des. He will not say so                                               4571
                                                                      4572
Oth. No: his mouth is stopp'd:                                        4573
Honest Iago hath 'tane order for't                                    4574
                                                                      4575
Des. Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead?                        4576
Oth. Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge                   4577
Had stomacke for them all                                             4578
                                                                      4579
Des. Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone                               4580
                                                                      4581
Oth. Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?                   4582
Des. O banish me, my Lord, but kill me not                            4583
                                                                      4584
Oth. Downe Strumpet                                                   4585
                                                                      4586
Des. Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night                          4587
                                                                      4588
Oth. Nay, if you striue                                               4589
                                                                      4590
Des. But halfe an houre                                               4591
                                                                      4592
Oth. Being done, there is no pawse                                    4593
                                                                      4594
Des. But while I say one prayer                                       4595
                                                                      4596
Oth. It is too late.                                                  4597
                                                                      4598
Smothers her.                                                         4599
                                                                      4600
aemilia at the doore.                                                 4601
                                                                      4602
Aemil. My Lord, my Lord? What hoa?                                    4603
My Lord, my Lord                                                      4604
                                                                      4605
Oth. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?                4606
I that am cruell, am yet mercifull,                                   4607
I would not haue thee linger in thy paine?                            4608
So, so.                                                               4609
Aemil. within. What hoa? my Lord, my Lord?                            4610
Oth. Who's there?                                                     4611
Aemil. Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word                         4612
with you                                                              4613
                                                                      4614
Oth. Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead.                       4615
'Tis like she comes to speake of Cassio's death:                      4616
The noise was high. Hah, no more moouing?                             4617
Still as the Graue. Shall she come in? Wer't good?                    4618
I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?                   4619
If she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife:                        4620
My wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife.                          4621
Oh insupportable! Oh heauy houre!                                     4622
Me thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse                           4623
Of Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe                    4624
Did yawne at Alteration.                                              4625
Aemil. I do beseech you                                               4626
That I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord                           4627
                                                                      4628
Oth. I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia.                           4629
Soft, by and by, let me the Curtaines draw.                           4630
Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now?                      4631
Enter aemilia.                                                        4632
                                                                      4633
Aemil. Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers                        4634
done                                                                  4635
                                                                      4636
Oth. What? now?                                                       4637
Aemil. But now, my Lord                                               4638
                                                                      4639
Oth. It is the very error of the Moone,                               4640
She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,                        4641
And makes men mad.                                                    4642
Aemil. Cassio, my Lord, hath kill'd                                   4643
A young Venetian, call'd Rodorigo                                     4644
                                                                      4645
Oth. Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd?                              4646
Aemil. No, Cassio is not kill'd                                       4647
                                                                      4648
Oth. Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,                   4649
And sweet Reuenge growes harsh                                        4650
                                                                      4651
Des. O falsely, falsely murder'd.                                     4652
Aemil. Alas! what cry is that?                                        4653
Oth. That? What?                                                      4654
Aemil. Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice.                       4655
Helpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe,                      4656
Sweet Desdemona, oh sweet Mistris, speake                             4657
                                                                      4658
Des. A guiltlesse death, I dye.                                       4659
Aemil. Oh who hath done this deed?                                    4660
Des. No body: I my selfe, farewell:                                   4661
Commend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell                              4662
                                                                      4663
Oth. Why, how should she be murdred?                                  4664
Aemil. Alas: who knowes?                                              4665
Oth. You heare her say her selfe, it was not I.                       4666
Aemil. She said so: I must needs report the truth                     4667
                                                                      4668
Oth. She's like a Liar gone to burning hell,                          4669
'Twas I that kill'd her.                                              4670
Aemil. Oh the more Angell she, and you the blacker                    4671
Diuell                                                                4672
                                                                      4673
Oth. She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.                        4674
Aemil. Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell                     4675
                                                                      4676
Oth. She was false as water.                                          4677
Aemil. Thou art rash as fire, to say                                  4678
That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true                          4679
                                                                      4680
Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.                        4681
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell:                           4682
But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds                              4683
To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.                           4684
Aemil. My Husband?                                                    4685
Oth. Thy Husband.                                                     4686
Aemil. That she was false to Wedlocke?                                4687
Oth. I, with Cassio: had she bin true,                                4688
If Heauen would make me such another world,                           4689
Of one entyre and perfect Chrysolite,                                 4690
I'ld not haue sold her for it.                                        4691
Aemil. My Husband?                                                    4692
Oth. I, 'twas he that told me on her first,                           4693
An honest man he is, and hates the slime                              4694
That stickes on filthy deeds.                                         4695
Aemil. My Husband?                                                    4696
Oth. What needs this itterance, Woman?                                4697
I say, thy Husband.                                                   4698
Aemil. Oh Mistris,                                                    4699
Villany hath made mockes with loue:                                   4700
My Husband say she was false?                                         4701
Oth. He, Woman;                                                       4702
I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?                         4703
My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago.                          4704
Aemil. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule                         4705
Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,                       4706
She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine                          4707
                                                                      4708
Oth. Hah?                                                             4709
Aemil. Do thy worst:                                                  4710
This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,                         4711
Then thou was't worthy her                                            4712
                                                                      4713
Oth. Peace, you were best.                                            4714
Aemil. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,                  4715
As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,                               4716
As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed                            4717
(I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,                       4718
Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:                 4719
The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.                   4720
Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.                                    4721
                                                                      4722
Mon. What is the matter? How now Generall?                            4723
Aemil. Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well,                    4724
That men must lay their Murthers on your necke                        4725
                                                                      4726
Gra. What is the matter?                                              4727
Aemil. Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:                  4728
He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:                   4729
I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.                   4730
Speake, for my heart is full                                          4731
                                                                      4732
Iago. I told him what I thought,                                      4733
And told no more                                                      4734
Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true.                        4735
Aemil. But did you euer tell him,                                     4736
She was false?                                                        4737
Iago. I did.                                                          4738
Aemil. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:                           4739
Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.                                   4740
Shee false with Cassio?                                               4741
Did you say with Cassio?                                              4742
Iago. With Cassio, Mistris?                                           4743
Go too, charme your tongue                                            4744
                                                                      4745
Emil. I will not charme my Tongue;                                    4746
I am bound to speake,                                                 4747
My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed                            4748
                                                                      4749
All. Oh Heauens, forefend                                             4750
                                                                      4751
Emil. And your reports haue set the Murder on                         4752
                                                                      4753
Othello. Nay stare not Masters,                                       4754
It is true indeede                                                    4755
                                                                      4756
Gra. 'Tis a strange Truth                                             4757
                                                                      4758
Mont. O monstrous Acte                                                4759
                                                                      4760
Emil. Villany, villany, villany:                                      4761
I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:                       4762
I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.                      4763
O villany! villany!                                                   4764
Iago. What, are you mad?                                              4765
I charge you get you home                                             4766
                                                                      4767
Emil. Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:                    4768
'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:                                  4769
Perchance Iago, I will ne're go home                                  4770
                                                                      4771
Oth. Oh, oh, oh                                                       4772
                                                                      4773
Emil. Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:                                 4774
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,                           4775
That ere did lift vp eye                                              4776
                                                                      4777
Oth. Oh she was fowle!                                                4778
I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,                   4779
Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:                 4780
I know this acte shewes horrible and grim                             4781
                                                                      4782
Gra. Poore Desdemon:                                                  4783
I am glad thy Father's dead,                                          4784
Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe                         4785
Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,                       4786
This sight would make him do a desperate turne:                       4787
Yea, curse his better Angell from his side,                           4788
And fall to Reprobance                                                4789
                                                                      4790
Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes                              4791
That she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame                           4792
A thousand times committed. Cassio confest it,                        4793
And she did gratifie his amorous workes                               4794
With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue                             4795
Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:                         4796
It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token                              4797
My Father gaue my Mother                                              4798
                                                                      4799
Emil. Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!                                  4800
Iago. Come, hold your peace                                           4801
                                                                      4802
Emil. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?                                4803
No, I will speake as liberall as the North;                           4804
Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,                        4805
All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake                       4806
                                                                      4807
Iago. Be wise, and get you home                                       4808
                                                                      4809
Emil. I will not                                                      4810
                                                                      4811
Gra. Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman                                     4812
                                                                      4813
Emil. Oh thou dull Moore,                                             4814
That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of                                   4815
I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:                          4816
For often, with a solemne earnestnesse,                               4817
(More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)                          4818
He begg'd of me, to steale't                                          4819
                                                                      4820
Iago. Villanous Whore                                                 4821
                                                                      4822
Emil. She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it,                        4823
And I did giu't my Husband                                            4824
                                                                      4825
Iago. Filth, thou lyest                                               4826
                                                                      4827
Emil. By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:                         4828
Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole                       4829
Do with so good a wife?                                               4830
Oth. Are there no stones in Heauen,                                   4831
But what serues for the Thunder?                                      4832
Precious Villaine                                                     4833
                                                                      4834
Gra. The woman falles:                                                4835
Sure he hath kill'd his Wife                                          4836
                                                                      4837
Emil. I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side                              4838
                                                                      4839
Gra. Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd                                4840
                                                                      4841
Mon. 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon                   4842
Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore:                                4843
Come guard the doore without, let him not passe,                      4844
But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,                    4845
For 'tis a damned Slaue.                                              4846
Enter.                                                                4847
                                                                      4848
Oth. I am not valiant neither:                                        4849
But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.                               4850
But why should Honor out-liue Honesty?                                4851
Let it go all.                                                        4852
Aemil. What did thy Song boad Lady?                                   4853
Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,                    4854
And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.                     4855
Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,                  4856
So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:                         4857
So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye                                  4858
                                                                      4859
Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,                           4860
It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:                     4861
Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth                               4862
                                                                      4863
Gra. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;                     4864
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer                         4865
                                                                      4866
Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,                       4867
Or naked as I am I will assault thee                                  4868
                                                                      4869
Gra. What is the matter?                                              4870
Othel. Behold, I haue a weapon:                                       4871
A better neuer did it selfe sustaine                                  4872
Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,                          4873
That with this little Arme, and this good Sword,                      4874
I haue made my way through more impediments                           4875
Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)                     4876
Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.                           4877
Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:                        4878
Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt                            4879
And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.                               4880
Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:                           4881
Man but a Rush against Othello's brest,                               4882
And he retires. Where should Othello go?                              4883
Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench,                   4884
Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,                     4885
This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,                  4886
And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?                   4887
Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!                       4888
Whip me ye Diuels,                                                    4889
From the possession of this Heauenly sight:                           4890
Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,                        4891
Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire.                        4892
Oh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh!                             4893
Enter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago, with Officers.             4894
                                                                      4895
Lod. Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?                    4896
Oth. That's he that was Othello: heere I am                           4897
                                                                      4898
Lod. Where is that Viper?                                             4899
Bring the Villaine forth                                              4900
                                                                      4901
Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,                4902
If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee                      4903
                                                                      4904
Lod. Wrench his Sword from him                                        4905
                                                                      4906
Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd                                     4907
                                                                      4908
Othel. I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:                   4909
For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die                               4910
                                                                      4911
Lod. Oh thou Othello, that was once so good,                          4912
Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,                              4913
What shall be saide to thee                                           4914
                                                                      4915
Oth. Why any thing:                                                   4916
An honourable Murderer, if you will:                                  4917
For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour                           4918
                                                                      4919
Lod. This wretch hath part confest his Villany:                       4920
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death                              4921
                                                                      4922
Oth. I                                                                4923
                                                                      4924
Cas. Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause                           4925
                                                                      4926
Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:                         4927
Will you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell,                            4928
Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body                           4929
                                                                      4930
Iag. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:                      4931
From this time forth, I neuer will speake word                        4932
                                                                      4933
Lod. What? not to pray?                                               4934
Gra. Torments will ope your lips                                      4935
                                                                      4936
Oth. Well, thou dost best                                             4937
                                                                      4938
Lod. Sir,                                                             4939
You shall vnderstand what hath befalne,                               4940
(Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter                  4941
Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo,                           4942
And heere another, the one of them imports                            4943
The death of Cassio, to be vndertooke                                 4944
By Rodorigo                                                           4945
                                                                      4946
Oth. O Villaine!                                                      4947
Cassio. Most Heathenish, and most grosse                              4948
                                                                      4949
Lod. Now, heere's another discontented paper                          4950
Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes                           4951
Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:                      4952
But that (belike) Iago in the interim                                 4953
Came in, and satisfi'd him                                            4954
                                                                      4955
Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;                                     4956
How came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe                           4957
That was my wiues?                                                    4958
Cassio. I found it in my Chamber:                                     4959
And he himselfe confest it but euen now,                              4960
That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,                        4961
Which wrought to his desire                                           4962
                                                                      4963
Othel. O Foole, foole, foole!                                         4964
Cassio. There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter,                       4965
How he vpbraides Iago, that he made him                               4966
Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came                              4967
That I was cast: and euen but now he spake                            4968
(After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,                              4969
Iago set him on                                                       4970
                                                                      4971
Lod. You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:                     4972
Your Power, and your Command is taken off,                            4973
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,                           4974
If there be any cunning Crueltie,                                     4975
That can torment him much, and hold him long,                         4976
It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,                       4977
Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne                          4978
To the Venetian State. Come, bring away                               4979
                                                                      4980
Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:                          4981
I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:                  4982
No more of that. I pray you in your Letters,                          4983
When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,                           4984
Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,                             4985
Nor set downe ought in malice.                                        4986
Then must you speake,                                                 4987
Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:                           4988
Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,                       4989
Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand                         4990
(Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away                            4991
Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,                4992
Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,                                  4993
Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees                             4994
Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:                          4995
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,                                 4996
Where a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke                                4997
Beate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State,                             4998

And smoate him, thus                                                  5000

Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,                 5006
Killing my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse.                                5007
                                                                      5008

Cas. This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon:                  5011
For he was great of heart                                             5012
                                                                      5013

And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore,                             5020
For they succeede on you. To you, Lord Gouernor,                      5021
Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine:                        5022
The Time, the Place, the Torture, oh inforce it:                      5023
